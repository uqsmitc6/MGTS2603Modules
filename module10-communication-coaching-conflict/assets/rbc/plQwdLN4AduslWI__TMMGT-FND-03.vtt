00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.350
<v ->Imagine that you ask your team</v>

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.230
to develop a new online training course.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.490
Your team submits the finished course to you for feedback,

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.470
but you realize that there's been a critical mistake.

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.130
Your team thought that the course was being designed

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.800
for the end user,

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.470
but you actually wanted a course that was tailored

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.870
to your company and for internal use only.

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.010
Oops.

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.670
This is an example of one of many reasons

11
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.890
you can't overlook the role that communication plays

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.420
in a team's success.

13
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240
So, what are the top goals

14
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.440
of communication in team management,

15
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.330
and how can you communicate more effectively with your team?

16
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.323
Let's explore the answers to these questions next.

17
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.850
First, you can use communication

18
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.230
as a tool to align your team.

19
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.020
An aligned team is one that has a shared direction, goal,

20
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.390
or objective that everyone is moving toward.

21
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.000
Everyone in the group knows what they're doing

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.990
and why they're doing it

23
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.723
so that team outcomes are cohesive and hit shared targets.

24
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.860
One way to align your team is to be direct

25
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.250
and clearly articulate shared objectives

26
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.960
at the beginning of new projects or meetings.

27
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.150
You might be even make this objective visual,

28
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.693
or write it down, to communicate it in various ways.

29
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050
Perhaps the most common communication goal

30
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.940
in team management is to inform your team.

31
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.070
For example, you may need to communicate important updates,

32
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.860
provide skills, or process training,

33
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.080
share knowledge, give directions,

34
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.083
or explain a new project.

35
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.510
It's essential to make information accessible,

36
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.710
clear, and easy to process or understand for your team.

37
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.630
Break complex ideas into smaller, more digestible pieces,

38
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.390
and then summarize your main points

39
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.170
at the end of your communications

40
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.973
to reinforce your message.

41
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.290
Next, your team needs to be able to rely on you

42
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.120
for support and direction.

43
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.490
They need to have a way to communicate problems promptly,

44
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310
ask questions when they need help,

45
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.323
and see clarification when they have doubts.

46
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.640
That's why it's a best practice

47
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.150
to adopt an open door policy.

48
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.960
Encourage your team to come to you with problems,

49
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.000
concerns, or questions.

50
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.500
Proactively ask your team if they need any support.

51
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.680
Team managers are also responsible

52
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.780
for motivating their teams.

53
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.840
This communication goal becomes especially important

54
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.090
when teams are facing challenges or setbacks.

55
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.180
You need to use your communication skills

56
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.750
to encourage your team, inspire them,

57
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.940
and foster positivity.

58
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.813
So, how do you do that?

59
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.470
Demonstrate positivity in your verbal

60
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.820
and nonverbal communications.

61
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.350
Talk about solutions rather than problems

62
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.430
and opportunities rather than challenges,

63
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.960
and use positive body language and tone

64
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.863
to express a motivating message.

65
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.300
It's also common for teams to work together

66
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.030
to brainstorm ideas or solutions.

67
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.050
Brainstorming sessions can easily get off track

68
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.203
and create imbalances in team member participation.

69
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.510
That's why it can be helpful to use open-ended questions

70
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.100
to steer the discussion in the right direction

71
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.693
and balance participation.

72
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.040
Finally, you may also use communication

73
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.720
as a tool to develop your team's skills.

74
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.340
You can do this by giving

75
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.160
and receiving constructive feedback.

76
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.610
Feedback should be a two-way street.

77
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.030
Set regular intervals to give positive

78
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.760
and constructive feedback to your team members.

79
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.170
Also, invite team members to give you feedback

80
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.070
on what they like, what they need from you,

81
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.680
or suggestions they have for you

82
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.563
to help them work more effectively.

83
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.600
Strong communication improves your team's ability

84
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.460
to collaborate and to identify and work through problems.

85
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.040
It also shields your team from potential conflicts.

86
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.730
Become a better communicator

87
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.513
to become a better team manager.
