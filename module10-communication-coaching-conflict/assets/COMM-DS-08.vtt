<v ->Difficult conversations are just that, difficult.</v>

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.650
Most people don't enjoy

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.560
telling a co-worker he needs to step up his work.

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.640
Or confronting a boss about her management style.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.010
Whether we like it or not these conversations

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.230
can get messy and emotional.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.300
They're also necessary.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.340
Effective communication requires us

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.440
to address, and work through issues

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.400
openly and constructively.

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.210
That's why it's important to learn the four steps

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410
for navigating difficult conversations.

13
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.320
Step one is all about preparation.

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.530
You don't want to head into a difficult conversation

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.540
without a solid plan.

16
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.470
Arm yourself with three things,

17
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.620
first prepare to describe the issue in one to two sentences,

18
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.480
stick to the facts, cut out your interpretation

19
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.690
or feelings about them.

20
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.300
Second identify your goals for the conversation.

21
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.240
What does resolution look like?

22
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.154
What is the ideal outcome?

23
00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:03.190
Finally try role playing both the best

24
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.960
and the worst case reactions from the other party.

25
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.680
Preparation is key to keeping your conversation

26
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.420
constructive and on track.

27
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.980
Let's move onto the second step, framing.

28
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.040
The first thing you will say will impact

29
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.420
the meaning of everything that follows.

30
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.340
So frame the conversation strategically.

31
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.439
Start by reasserting your shared interests or goals.

32
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.667
You might say "I know how much

33
00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.720
"we both want to sign this client,"

34
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.820
before transitioning into the difficult topic.

35
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.020
Recognize the strengths of the other party

36
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.070
before sharing weaknesses.

37
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.500
Express your appreciation for their work,

38
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.455
or acknowledge their context or the challenges they faced.

39
00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:46.510
The third step is the actual discussion

40
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.380
where you delve into the difficult topic.

41
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.510
Try this strategy for

42
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.170
structuring your discussion effectively.

43
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.230
Start by stating the issue, again stick to the facts

44
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.750
and specific examples of the issue.

45
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.410
Avoid making accusations

46
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.180
or using emotionally charged language.

47
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.800
Then, share how the problematic behavior

48
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.020
had an impact on you.

49
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.650
Use I statements to express

50
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.883
your interpretation of the situation.

51
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.710
Finally invite the other party to share their perspective.

52
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.140
Ask questions to understand their side.

53
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.060
Continue the discussion from there

54
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.990
and work together to reach a common understanding,

55
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.410
agreement or action plan.

56
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.090
The final step is wrapping things up.

57
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.760
Summarize any outcomes, insights

58
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.810
or action items that came out of your discussion.

59
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.020
And don't forget to ask the other person

60
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.102
if they have anything else they want to discuss

61
00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:44.050
before you end the conversation.

62
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.222
The number of difficult conversations you encounter

63
00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:49.241
will likely increase as you gain more responsibility

64
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:51.720
and leadership roles in your career.

65
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.210
Don't avoid them.

66
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.630
Approach difficult conversations tactfully

67
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.590
and with a clear plan.

68
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.380
While having difficult conversations isn't fun,

69
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.120
when you confront issues head on

70
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.840
you're more likely to resolve them,

71
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.723
reach understandings and grow.
