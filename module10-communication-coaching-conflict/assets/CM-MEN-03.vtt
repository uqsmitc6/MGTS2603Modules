00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.450
<v ->Do you have professional knowledge</v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.600
or experience that others can benefit from?

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.870
Do you enjoy helping others?

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.330
Are you looking for a new challenge?

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.290
Do you want to grow your influence,

6
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.160
expand your leadership skills,

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.890
or gain recognition from your peers?

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.370
If you answered yes to these questions,

9
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.040
then you might be a good candidate for becoming a mentor.

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.870
Being a mentor is a great way

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.300
to pass on the skills and lessons

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.850
that you've learned to a less experienced employee.

13
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.470
You get the satisfaction of helping a mentee

14
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.370
advance their career, and the benefit

15
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.980
of having someone to talk up your impact

16
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.940
and leadership skills.

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.670
But what does mentorship actually mean?

18
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.000
Here's a short introduction to who a mentor is,

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.683
what a mentor does, and how to become a better mentor.

20
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.790
First, as mentioned earlier,

21
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.030
a mentor is someone who gives advice and guidance

22
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.720
to a less experienced employee.

23
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.110
Mentors meet regularly with their mentees

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200
for a predetermined period.

25
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.690
So, you might agree to meet periodically

26
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.730
over six months or a year,

27
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.710
or you might agree to keep meeting

28
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.600
until the mentee achieves a specific goal.

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.460
It's up to you and your mentee

30
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.250
to decide the frequency and duration of your meetings.

31
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.265
What's most important that you meet regularly.

32
00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:28.630
Now, what do you actually do in your mentoring meetings?

33
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.080
It's up to the mentee to decide the objective

34
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.290
of each meeting, or how they could use your help.

35
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.820
That means your role is to listen,

36
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.080
facilitate, and respond with probing questions,

37
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.040
provide advice or feedback,

38
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.940
or even challenge your mentee with assignments.

39
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.453
Let's expand on this.

40
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.300
Mentors listen to their mentees aspirations,

41
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.850
challenges, and concerns with an empathetic ear.

42
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.160
They can also act as a sounding board for mentee's ideas.

43
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.380
They advise mentees based on their own knowledge

44
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.750
and experiences, and they may need to coach mentees

45
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.550
to clarify goals, hone their skills,

46
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.130
and develop action plans.

47
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.200
Mentors also challenge mentees

48
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.530
by giving constructive feedback,

49
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.890
asking probing questions, and assigning exercises.

50
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.359
They connect mentees with relevant people,

51
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.600
resources, or opportunities,

52
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.420
and they advocate for mentees when it makes sense,

53
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.660
but above all, a mentor acts as a role model

54
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.960
for their mentee.

55
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.120
They model the attitudes and behaviors

56
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.823
that have contributed to their own success.

57
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.550
When you consider everything that a mentor does,

58
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.090
some themes start to emerge

59
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.060
about what makes a great mentor,

60
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.630
or how you can become a better one.

61
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.210
Mentors should listen more than they talk.

62
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.550
Follow your mentee's lead,

63
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.250
and encourage them to communicate

64
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.570
where they could best use your help.

65
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.200
Also, ask probing questions

66
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.194
to facilitate a deeper understanding.

67
00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:03.360
These are open ended questions

68
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.200
that challenge your mentee to think about an issue,

69
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.920
or topic in a new way or on a deeper level.

70
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.870
For example, you can ask a mentee,

71
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.450
"What do you want to happen?

72
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.420
What are you afraid will happen?"

73
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.930
Or, "Why do you think or say that?"

74
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.960
Finally, the best mentors make their sessions actionable.

75
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.100
Offer your advice on what your mentee can do

76
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.840
to work toward their goals,

77
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.200
whether that means assigning them a practice exercise,

78
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.180
giving them an article to read,

79
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.810
encouraging them to adopt a new habit,

80
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.280
or brainstorming ideas

81
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.450
and developing an action plan together.

82
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.450
Mentoring others can be a challenging

83
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.410
and rewarding experience,

84
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.900
but when both parties are committed

85
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
to the mentoring relationship

86
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.540
and invest in regular meetings,

87
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.380
you may be surprised by the impact

88
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.150
you can have on your mentee,

89
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.453
and even what your mentee can teach you.
