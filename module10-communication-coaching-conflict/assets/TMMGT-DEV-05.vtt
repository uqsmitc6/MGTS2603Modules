00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.470
<v ->Coaching is a powerful technique</v>

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.700
that managers can use to engage their teams,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.290
facilitate deeper learning,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.320
and encourage professional development.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.170
But coaching may not be what you think it is.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.810
Coaching is not the same thing as teaching,

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.260
and a coach does not serve in the role

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.670
of the expert in a coaching session.

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.060
So what is coaching then?

10
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.200
What's involved?

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.660
And what strategies can you use to be an effective coach?

12
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.060
Let's start with the basics.

13
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.290
Coaching is a collaborative process

14
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.220
in which managers and team members work together

15
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.400
to discuss goals,

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.940
identify opportunities for improvement,

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.830
and create action plans for problem solving

18
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.423
or professional development.

19
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.990
In a coaching relationship,

20
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.890
the individual is the expert of their own situation.

21
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.090
The coach is merely a facilitator

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.720
who's there to ask probing questions and solicit new ideas

23
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.400
or insights from the individual.

24
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.700
They don't tell an individual what to do

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.023
or how to think.

26
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.620
That's why coaching can create

27
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.320
a greater sense of ownership and empowerment.

28
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.990
The individual is ultimately responsible

29
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.330
for coming up with the ideas and making the decisions.

30
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.010
So what's involved in coaching

31
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.040
and how do you become a better coach?

32
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.100
Coaching isn't always a clear-cut process.

33
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.110
It involves asking a lot of probing questions,

34
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.470
listening, summarizing, and observing patterns.

35
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.920
Having a coaching model or framework

36
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.950
can help bring structure or clarity

37
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.870
to your coaching conversations.

38
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.230
The GROW coaching model is a great place to start.

39
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.550
It was developed by business coaches,

40
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.740
Graham Alexander, Alan Fine, and Sir John Whitmore.

41
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.853
Here's how it works.

42
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.790
The G in GROW stands for setting a goal.

43
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.970
That means you'll start each coaching session

44
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.810
by asking the individual to set a goal

45
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.870
or clear objective for your time together.

46
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.567
So you might ask,

47
00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.897
"What would you like to get out of this coaching session?

48
00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.647
"What's the next professional goal

49
00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:15.867
"that you're working toward?

50
00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.510
"What skill do you want to develop?"

51
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.807
or "What's been holding you back?"

52
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.020
Next, the R in GROW stands for examine the current reality.

53
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.920
After a goal is set,

54
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.900
coaches should invite the individual

55
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.810
to describe their current performance

56
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.193
or current context and situation.

57
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.887
Try asking questions like,

58
00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:40.417
"What steps have you already taken?

59
00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:42.807
"What's your current process?

60
00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:45.700
"What are your current constraints?"

61
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.227
You might also ask,

62
00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:50.227
"Describe your current performance or situation."

63
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.840
Encourage your team member

64
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.230
to be accurate in their descriptions not judgemental.

65
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.120
You both need to understand the current situation

66
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.560
before you can change it.

67
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.200
Third, the O in GROW stands for explore options.

68
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.900
Your goal in this step is to solicit ideas

69
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.150
from the individual on all of the possible ways

70
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.340
that they might achieve their goal.

71
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.920
Challenge them to generate as many options as possible.

72
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.850
No idea is a bad one at this stage.

73
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.227
So you might ask,

74
00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:25.567
"What steps could you take to achieve this goal?

75
00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.420
"What else could you do?"

76
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.277
and, "What would you need to start

77
00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:32.960
"or stop doing to accomplish X?"

78
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.450
Last but not least, the W in GROW stands for

79
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.820
determine the way forward.

80
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.440
That means you need to encourage the individual

81
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.930
to select a solution and then develop

82
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.973
an action plan for implementing it.

83
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.037
Questions that can help you in this step include,

84
00:03:50.037 --> 00:03:52.947
"What option will give you the best results?

85
00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:57.397
"What option sounds most effective and realistic to you?

86
00:03:57.397 --> 00:04:00.083
"What would you need to do to make this happen?

87
00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:03.347
"How will you define success?

88
00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:05.750
"What resources do you need?"

89
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.977
and "When will you make it happen?"

90
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.250
One more time,

91
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.830
the GROW model of coaching stands for

92
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.290
set a goal,

93
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.500
examine the current reality,

94
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.000
explore options,

95
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.980
and determine the way forward.

96
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.300
So the next time a team member comes to you

97
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.000
for the answer or direction,

98
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.480
try out the GROW model of coaching.

99
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.640
It's a great way to help your team cultivate

100
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.200
the confidence, skills, and thought processes

101
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.800
they need to make decisions

102
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.683
and solve problems independently.
