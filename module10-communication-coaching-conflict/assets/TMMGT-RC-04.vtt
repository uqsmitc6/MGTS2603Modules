<v ->When left unmanaged,</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.140
conflict can create havoc on your team.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.470
Employees' interpersonal issue can stand in the way

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.980
of effective communication and collaboration.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.540
It can create an environment

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.920
that feels tense, hostile, or even toxic.

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.730
When managed well, conflict brings issues

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.610
to team members' awareness and inspires honest dialogue.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.460
It facilitates problem-solving, creates new understanding,

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.400
and encourages team members

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.500
to learn how to work better together.

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.640
As a manager, your leadership

13
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
and conflict resolution skills are instrumental.

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.550
How you handle conflict can determine

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.180
whether conflict unravels your team or makes it stronger.

16
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.760
Your team will be looking at you for direction.

17
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.800
And you can look to the following tips

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.433
and techniques for guidance.

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.480
First, let's start with the basics.

20
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.350
Bring the employees who are involved

21
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.100
in the conflict together for discussion.

22
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.300
Always set ground rules for the discussion before you begin.

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.730
Ground rules are your code of conduct

24
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.060
or rules for conversation.

25
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.530
Get team members to agree

26
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.190
on how they will talk about the problem.

27
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.890
For example, you should always make a ground rule

28
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.860
that says each person treats the other part with respect.

29
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.787
Or another good idea for a ground rule is,

30
00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:30.730
"No interrupting the other person while they're speaking."

31
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.890
Use your authority to set some basic ground rules.

32
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.783
Then invite employees to add a few of their own.

33
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.360
The only rule on ground rules

34
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.290
is that before discussions can continue,

35
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.750
all parties must agree on the ground rules

36
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.763
and verbalize their commitment to adhere to them.

37
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870
Another tip for conflict resolution

38
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.550
is to let each person tell their side of the story.

39
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.630
Setting ground rules creates a safe space for open dialogue.

40
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.660
Encourage each person to say

41
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.880
what they want the other person to hear

42
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.773
and ask for what they need or want to change.

43
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.650
Respect and acknowledge the validity

44
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.440
of each person's experiences, feelings, and needs.

45
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.550
Finally, be a neutral and active listener

46
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.620
while each person shares their experience.

47
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.930
It's essential that you give both parties

48
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.430
equal attention and speaking time.

49
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.150
Never take sides.

50
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.590
Instead, try to summarize or paraphrase what you're hearing.

51
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.490
Always ask if your observations

52
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.150
and understanding are correct.

53
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.170
All together, ground rules create shared norms

54
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.900
and expectations, which create a space

55
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.980
for open and empathetic communication.

56
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.740
Taking turns sharing stories facilitates understanding.

57
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.470
Employees can communicate the impact of specific behaviors

58
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.033
or situations and ask for what they need.

59
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.050
Finally, being a neutral and active listener

60
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.190
maintains the balance and offers an outside perspective.

61
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.990
But how else can you keep the conversation moving forward?

62
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.400
Here are three techniques to accelerate

63
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.283
your progress toward resolution.

64
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.080
The first technique is to use incomplete sentences.

65
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.550
This involves giving employees sentences with omitted words

66
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.970
that they must fill in with their own response.

67
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.460
For example, you might prompt employees

68
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.160
to fill in the sentence, "I felt blank when you blank."

69
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.797
Or even, "I need blank so that blank."

70
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.940
This technique is great for soliciting a response

71
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.720
from a reserved or withdrawn employee

72
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.590
or even curtailing the lengthy

73
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.793
and convoluted response of a long-winded employee.

74
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.350
Second is to find your baseline.

75
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.250
If things get heated or employees are struggling to agree,

76
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.700
then help them get back to a basic place of understanding.

77
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.850
That's your baseline.

78
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.840
For example, you might ask employees questions

79
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.127
like, "What are the goals of the project?

80
00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:07.397
"What are the constraints?

81
00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:11.000
"What are the expectations of employee conduct?"

82
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.977
Or, "How are work results being impacted?"

83
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.310
Most employees will be able to agree

84
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.730
on a response to these basic questions,

85
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.700
and that will help them to refocus

86
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.930
on shared big-picture items

87
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.423
instead of on their own side or less significant details.

88
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.400
And third is to compare and contrast.

89
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.840
This technique involves asking each party

90
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.270
to compare and contrast what happened in the past

91
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.360
with what they'd like to happen in the future.

92
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.827
For example, "In the past,

93
00:04:43.827 --> 00:04:46.187
"I've been assigned tasks at the last minute

94
00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:49.647
"and told I must complete them by the end of the day.

95
00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:53.077
"In the future, I'd like at least 24-hours notice

96
00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:55.290
"before a task is due."

97
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.590
Use this technique when you wanna transition

98
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.370
the conversation to be more future-focused

99
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.053
and solutions-oriented.

100
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.080
Addressing and effectively resolving conflict isn't easy.

101
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.920
But with some guidance and direct communication,

102
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.760
it can be done.

103
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.640
Use these tips and techniques to help employees

104
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.730
work through conflict effectively

105
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.183
and come out of the other side a better team because of it.
