<v ->Change management models can help break down</v>

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.040
complicated change processes into straightforward steps.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.164
This video explores one of the best known options,

4
00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:15.810
Kotter's Eight-Step Change Model.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.760
Developed by Dr. John Kotter,

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.150
a Harvard University business professor,

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.510
this model can serve as a useful roadmap

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.883
for implementing organizational change.

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.230
Kotter's model emphasizes that change

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.540
is most likely to succeed when employees support it.

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.340
That's why this model focuses on creating ownership

12
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.710
and buy-in from team members.

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.030
The model's eight steps are distributed across three phases.

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.040
The first phase, defining the change, sets the stage.

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.800
This phase focuses on developing a vision,

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.830
understanding the why behind the change,

17
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.280
and leveraging enthusiastic early adopters.

18
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.020
The second phase, implementing the change,

19
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.080
starts when leaders engage the entire organization,

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.450
rallying employees around the change.

21
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.990
This phase helps everyone understand their roles

22
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.770
and establishes change-related goals.

23
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.660
The final phase, securing the change,

24
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.460
builds on early momentum to cement the change

25
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.513
as a permanent part of the organization.

26
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770
Now that you understand the basic phases of the model,

27
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.860
let's look at the steps in each phase in more detail,

28
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.913
starting with phase one, defining the change.

29
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.510
The first step of this phase

30
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.910
is to create a sense of urgency.

31
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.030
During this step, change leaders convey

32
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.850
why the change is necessary,

33
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.200
play out possible scenarios and outcomes,

34
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.100
and share evidence to support the change.

35
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.120
In step two, building a core coalition,

36
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.090
change leaders gather those most likely

37
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.220
to advocate for the change.

38
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.260
Coalition members should have high levels of social capital,

39
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
status, or expertise, along with enthusiasm for the change.

40
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.420
The final step of phase one is forming a strategic vision.

41
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.530
Change leaders and coalition members

42
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.410
need to explain how the change aligns with company values

43
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.573
in this third step.

44
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.390
At the end of phase one,

45
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.630
leaders should concentrate on sharing strategies

46
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.770
for achieving the change and describing how things will look

47
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.060
once the change has been implemented.

48
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.100
In other words, what does the ideal future look like

49
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.263
after the change?

50
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.240
Once the first phase is complete,

51
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.900
the model progresses to phase two, implementing the change,

52
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.080
which encompasses steps four through six

53
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.730
of the eight-step model.

54
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.990
Let's explore those now.

55
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.610
Step four of Kotter's model is communicating the vision.

56
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.660
Here, change discussions expand to a wider audience.

57
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.110
Company-wide updates should start now,

58
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.250
emphasizing enthusiasm for the change

59
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.020
and modeling behaviors that support it.

60
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.220
Step five focuses on removing barriers.

61
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.020
Obstacles to successful change may become apparent now.

62
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.410
That gives leaders the chance to address setbacks,

63
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.200
like employee resistance, work disruptions caused by change,

64
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560
or waning enthusiasm.

65
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.600
Step six, generating short-term wins,

66
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.330
uses early success to motivate the team.

67
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.010
In this step, change leaders find opportunities

68
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.580
to achieve and celebrate short-term goals

69
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.163
associated with the change.

70
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.170
What does a short-term win look like?

71
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.540
Imagine an organization has set the long-term change goal

72
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.010
of reducing its carbon footprint.

73
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.660
A short-term win could be completing a review

74
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.590
of company travel practices

75
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.400
and replacing non-essential travel

76
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.840
with virtual meetings and online training sessions.

77
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.570
Some of the cost savings that reduced travel generates

78
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.650
could then be used to reward employees

79
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.113
for embracing the change.

80
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.920
The final phase of Kotter's model is securing the change.

81
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.780
As the team nears the finish line,

82
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.850
steps seven and eight provide the push

83
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.070
to make the change permanent.

84
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.880
Step seven is sustaining acceleration.

85
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.900
The change is now in motion.

86
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.590
While it might be tempting to ease intensity,

87
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.950
Kotter's model reminds us

88
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.800
that now is the time to go full tilt.

89
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.260
Continue to generate quick wins, listen to feedback,

90
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.150
and adjust as you learn along the way.

91
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.450
The final step, step eight, is instituting the change.

92
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.710
The change should move from adopting new ideas

93
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.760
to just the way we do things around here.

94
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.970
After the change becomes a permanent fixture

95
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.630
of the organization, anchor it by sharing success stories

96
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.570
and rewarding team members who played an integral role

97
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.123
in the initiative's success.

98
00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.800
Kotter's eight-step model has endured

99
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.840
as a go-to change management model for over two decades.

100
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.880
Why?

101
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.660
Because the framework breaks down

102
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.160
complicated change processes into clear, achievable steps.

103
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.310
If your organization could benefit

104
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.840
from an approach to change that shows leaders

105
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.190
exactly how to transform a theoretical vision

106
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.150
into a thriving reality,

107
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.113
Kotter's model might be right for you.
