00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:06.550
<v ->Grab a dictionary and look up the word change</v>

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.140
and you'll see some troubling associations.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.300
Change can result in uncertainty, instability and chaos,

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.440
things that aren't always associated with success.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.810
So how do you keep innovating

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.150
without spiraling out of control?

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.300
Change management models can introduce order

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.080
back into the equation.

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.550
Let's explore these models

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.763
and examine five of the most common ones.

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.630
Change management models are frameworks for driving

12
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.930
and understanding organizational change.

13
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.530
Multiple models exist,

14
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.450
all with different purposes and functions.

15
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.420
For example, some models help businesses decide

16
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.780
what to change.

17
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.140
Others guide organizations

18
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.920
through the implementation process

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.170
and some help companies recognize

20
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.023
and respond to their employees' emotional reactions.

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.940
Following a change management model

22
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.120
leaves fewer things up to chance.

23
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.740
A model can help you set realistic expectations

24
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.410
and guide you through reliable steps.

25
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.890
The easiest way to make sense of this concept

26
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.400
is to explore some popular frameworks.

27
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.583
Let break down five fundamental models and how they work.

28
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.180
First is the McKinsey 7S model

29
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.320
which identifies seven elements that companies must align

30
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.970
when planning for and implementing change.

31
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.140
The elements are split into two categories.

32
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.291
We begin with hard S's which are concrete.

33
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.300
First, strategy refers to your company's goals

34
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.050
and business plan.

35
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.940
Structure covers how departments and teams are organized

36
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.233
and systems are your company's procedures and rules.

37
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.360
Next, the McKinsey model looks at soft S's

38
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.883
which are more subjective.

39
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.740
The list begins with shared values,

40
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.543
the things that matter most to your company and teams.

41
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.330
Next is style.

42
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.653
How are things done?

43
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.890
Then, there's your staff, the people doing the work.

44
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.513
Finally, what are your employees' skills and talents?

45
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.840
The McKinsey model sheds light on company weak spots

46
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.962
to help determine what needs to change.

47
00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:10.130
This model can also help ensure

48
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.283
that your organization stays aligned throughout the process.

49
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.200
If you need implementation help,

50
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.250
try Lewin's 3-Step model.

51
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.257
This strategy breaks change into three stages.

52
00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:24.200
First, you must unfreeze the status quo

53
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.070
and get everyone ready for the transition.

54
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.066
Next, you put the proposed change into practice,

55
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:34.313
allowing employees to learn, make mistakes and adjust.

56
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.100
Finally, the organization locks the change into place

57
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.720
for the refreeze stage.

58
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.215
The old way of doing things is officially out.

59
00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:46.390
Overall, Lewin's model helps organizations

60
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.280
communicate their plan, implement that change,

61
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.080
and make the transition stick

62
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.193
by outlining what to expect and do during each stage.

63
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.940
If you're hoping for a more people-focused approach,

64
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.500
consider Kotter's 8-Step model.

65
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.160
Begin by creating a sense of urgency.

66
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.320
Then, build a core coalition

67
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.010
to drive the proposed change forward.

68
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100
Next, create a strategy

69
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.170
around how things will be done differently

70
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.020
and form a strategic vision.

71
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.340
With that in place,

72
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.150
get everyone on the same page by communicating the vision.

73
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.730
And then, remove barriers by identifying obstacles

74
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.450
to the change.

75
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.990
Once the change is deployed,

76
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.440
you can focus on generating short-term wins.

77
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.831
To sustain acceleration,

78
00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:34.559
analyze what is and isn't working

79
00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.800
and make adjustments.

80
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.099
Finally, you institute the change as an integral part

81
00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.803
of the workplace culture.

82
00:03:42.673 --> 00:03:46.200
Through strategic planning and gradual implementation,

83
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.580
Kotter's model creates a sense of urgency

84
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.680
and prepares employees for change,

85
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.686
helping them become more receptive to upcoming transitions.

86
00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:57.900
If you wanna take the people-focused approach further,

87
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.780
consider the Kubler-Ross model

88
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.890
which is split into five emotional, nonlinear stages.

89
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.760
The first stage is denial,

90
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.780
a refusal to believe that change is happening.

91
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.300
Next is anger,

92
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.130
when employees are hostile toward the change.

93
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.094
When they accept the change's inevitability,

94
00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:18.370
employees move into the bargaining stage.

95
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.900
If employees feel like they don't have control,

96
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.103
they may enter a state of depression.

97
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.280
Finally, once employees resigned to the change,

98
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.066
they've reached acceptance of the new normal.

99
00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:32.640
Given its focus on emotions,

100
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.579
the Kubler-Ross model is best for companies

101
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.850
hoping to empathize with employees

102
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.093
and respond to their emotions appropriately.

103
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.420
The last strategy we'll consider is the Satir model

104
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.510
which predicts and tracks

105
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.230
how emotions impact performance in five steps.

106
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.660
First is the late status quo

107
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.090
which refers to life before change.

108
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.610
Employees feel comfortable

109
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.360
and performance is fairly consistent.

110
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.830
Next, a change is introduced.

111
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.820
Employees may resist the change

112
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.373
resulting in a sudden performance drop.

113
00:05:04.373 --> 00:05:08.210
When the change is implemented, chaos ensues.

114
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.630
Companies can expect performance to decline

115
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.743
as employees may feel confused and anxious.

116
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.965
Over time, employees adjust

117
00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:19.720
and enter the integration stage.

118
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.780
Performance improves for the first time

119
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.120
since the change was introduced.

120
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.760
Finally, the change becomes the new status quo.

121
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760
If all goes according to plan,

122
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.541
performance reaches its highest level yet.

123
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:36.160
While the Satir model doesn't affect employee performance,

124
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.200
it does help set realistic expectations,

125
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.893
plus, it makes tracking performance easier.

126
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.550
Change is unstable

127
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.630
but you don't need to go at it alone.

128
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.740
Change management models can help you through shaky times,

129
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.540
giving you a clear roadmap to plot expectations

130
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.440
and action steps.

131
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.180
By taking advantage of change management models,

132
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.930
you can chart a course for success

133
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.503
and your next change process.
