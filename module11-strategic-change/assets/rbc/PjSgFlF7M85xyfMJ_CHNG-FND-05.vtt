00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.320
<v ->A large crowd assembles in the corporate office,</v>

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.750
not sure why they've been called together.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.360
The CEO steps forward

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.751
and announces that market changes

5
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:14.150
have forced the company's hand.

6
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.320
The business will be pivoting

7
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.900
to a completely different product

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.530
by the next quarter.

9
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.260
The CEO concludes by saying

10
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.200
that managers will be instructing their teams

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.470
in the next few weeks

12
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.190
as the product line develops,

13
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.880
then leaves the room.

14
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.680
Within hours, full panic has set in.

15
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.140
Rumors are flying.

16
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.700
Will people be fired?

17
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.690
Will the new product even work?

18
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.640
Is the company going under?

19
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.046
It's not a promising start

20
00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.300
for what could have been

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.430
an exciting new phase

22
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.780
for the business.

23
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.658
When change initiatives fail,

24
00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:44.777
it's often because

25
00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.760
leaders with great business ideas

26
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.410
fail to account for the human reactions

27
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.140
of their employees.

28
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.010
So let's review some of the most common

29
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.720
challenges to change management

30
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.363
and how to overcome them.

31
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.510
First, poor communication

32
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.448
can stop a plan in its tracks.

33
00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:04.028
People fear what they don't understand.

34
00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:05.740
To overcome this barrier,

35
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.160
make a communication plan.

36
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.290
Include why the change is necessary,

37
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.930
and be clear about roles and responsibilities

38
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.348
for the initiative.

39
00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:16.320
A communication plan

40
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.610
can't stop with the big announcement.

41
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.770
Keep the team in the loop

42
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.730
through multi-channel communication

43
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.100
and make sure it's not just one way communication.

44
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.770
Set aside time for listening

45
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.290
and discussions with team members

46
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.823
as the project progresses.

47
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.520
The second hurdle is disengagement.

48
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.920
Employees who feel shut out

49
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.378
from the change may reject it,

50
00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:40.290
resulting in low morale and poor participation.

51
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.310
Instead, engage employees

52
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.980
by giving them active roles,

53
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.303
and listening to their ideas and feedback.

54
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.670
Start by showing the gap

55
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.300
between what's happening today

56
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.778
and the vision you're aiming for.

57
00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.300
Then demonstrate the benefits

58
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.940
for the business and employees

59
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.723
when that future state is achieved.

60
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.610
The third challenge is lackluster planning.

61
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.260
Without detailed and thoughtful preparation,

62
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.250
the change can veer off course.

63
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.020
That will waste time, energy, and money.

64
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.040
Instead, start with a strategy

65
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.370
that includes milestones

66
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.940
for measuring progress and success.

67
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.290
Include clear ideas

68
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.580
about the training, resources,

69
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.373
and timelines needed to get there.

70
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.760
The best part about a robust strategy

71
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.830
is that measurable and actionable goals

72
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.330
can be evaluated and tweaked

73
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.190
as the project moves forward.

74
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.600
Make changes as necessary

75
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.914
to keep the project on track.

76
00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:37.060
The fourth common pitfall is burnout.

77
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.700
Too much change can feel intolerably stressful,

78
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.720
and team members may

79
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.070
get overwhelmed and give up.

80
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.810
Instead, try a phased approach.

81
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.640
Break the project into smaller chunks

82
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.330
to initiate over time.

83
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.679
Or start with a small change

84
00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.073
and scale it a up.

85
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.800
One word of caution.

86
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.290
Prioritize these phases strategically.

87
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.123
Start with the change

88
00:02:58.123 --> 00:02:59.980
that most impacts others

89
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.340
or solves the most painful problem.

90
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.240
Doing so will help the remaining stages

91
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.363
run more smoothly.

92
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.260
The final problem is management mutiny.

93
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.879
Employees won't buy into a change

94
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.980
if their managers are indifferent

95
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.560
or hostile to the proposal.

96
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.470
Instead, ensure alignment

97
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.940
by involving managers early

98
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.870
to get their buy-in, understanding, and advocacy.

99
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.790
They can also offer helpful feedback

100
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.950
from the front lines

101
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.583
to make the initiative workable.

102
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.180
Change is inevitable,

103
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.340
but it doesn't have to be painful.

104
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.267
With careful planning

105
00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:34.840
and thoughtful consideration

106
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.880
for the people at the heart of the business,

107
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.330
you can motivate your team to move

108
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.203
toward a brighter future together.
