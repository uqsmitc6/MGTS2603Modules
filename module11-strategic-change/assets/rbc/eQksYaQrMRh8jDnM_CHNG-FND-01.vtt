00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.890
<v ->Think about the last time</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.510
you experienced a change.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.600
Did you feel uncomfortable, scared, frustrated?

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.550
Or were you excited to experience something new?

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.850
Leaving the comfort and safety

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.360
of the known for the unknown

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.680
can be difficult,

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.760
which is why organizations

9
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.450
must manage change well.

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.810
Change management refers

11
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.240
to the process of implement a change

12
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.900
and the skill of guiding people through change.

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.890
Before we dive into change management fundamentals,

14
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.900
let's first review

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.073
what organizational change means.

16
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.410
Organizations undergo many types of change.

17
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.070
The change may be planned,

18
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.140
like instituting a new software platform,

19
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.740
or unplanned, like responding to a crisis.

20
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.900
Whether planned or unplanned,

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.130
change typically falls

22
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.360
into one of three categories.

23
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.478
Developmental change

24
00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:54.780
is the most common type of change

25
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.410
and it encompasses improvements

26
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.180
to current procedures.

27
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.230
Examples of developmental change include

28
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.510
shifts in performance expectations

29
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.900
and updates to procedures.

30
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.200
Transitional change

31
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.620
is more complex

32
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.900
and requires letting go of something old

33
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.940
and embracing something new.

34
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.710
Examples of transitional change

35
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.820
include technology adoptions, mergers,

36
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.950
or the addition of new products and services.

37
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.210
Transformational change

38
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.370
is the most radical type of change

39
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.000
and results in a fundamental shift

40
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.610
in the organization.

41
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940
At the outset of transformational change,

42
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.430
the future is largely unknown.

43
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.790
This change includes major cultural shifts,

44
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.520
drastic reform of a company's offerings,

45
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.770
or significant changes to the business model.

46
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.900
Responding to change effectively begins

47
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.270
with understanding what is prompting it.

48
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.660
External forces of change

49
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.309
originate outside the company.

50
00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:49.020
These are factors primarily

51
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.500
outside an organization's control.

52
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.870
Internal forces of change

53
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.700
develop within the company's environment.

54
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.330
Let's look at some common examples

55
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.913
of external and internal forces of change.

56
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.550
Some common examples of

57
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.130
external forces of change

58
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.884
in an organization include

59
00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.870
technological innovations,

60
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.570
especially those that become the industry norm

61
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.789
or significantly improve

62
00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.719
the current technology.

63
00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.330
Government forces

64
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.370
like changes in the political landscape,

65
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.641
new regulations or deregulation efforts.

66
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.188
Economic forces like a recession,

67
00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:25.030
supply chain disruptions,

68
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.520
or fluctuations in supply and demand.

69
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.000
Competitive forces such as

70
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.820
pressure from new or existing competitors,

71
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.250
emerging markets,

72
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.400
or the introduction

73
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.723
of global competitors.

74
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.440
And customer driven forces

75
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.970
like persistent negative customer feedback,

76
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.680
the loss of customers to competitors,

77
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.383
or shifting customer expectations.

78
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.020
Internal forces of change typically begin

79
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.460
with dissatisfaction with the status quo

80
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.010
and the desire to get to some future state.

81
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.843
Let's take a look

82
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.283
at some examples of internal forces of change.

83
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.730
Some common examples of

84
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.999
internal forces of change

85
00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.169
in an organization include

86
00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.830
the introduction of new leadership,

87
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.770
especially when new leaders prompt a shift

88
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.560
in the company's culture or values.

89
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.840
Low performance or consistent failure

90
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.330
to meet expectations,

91
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.920
requiring a change to remedy it.

92
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.530
Structural issues like the persistent lack

93
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.670
of cross-functional communication,

94
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.590
managerial staff changes,

95
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.640
or the lack of cooperation between teams.

96
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.860
An internal crisis

97
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.060
like a lawsuit, employee strike, or scandal.

98
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.540
Cost cutting measures such as layoffs

99
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.000
or significant budget reductions.

100
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.690
And a changing workforce,

101
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.440
like an influx of younger workers

102
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.438
who have significant generational differences

103
00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:46.343
from their older, outgoing counterparts.

104
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.080
Regardless of the type of change

105
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.390
a company faces,

106
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.810
the change will likely cause disruptions.

107
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.350
The goal of change management

108
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.030
is to minimize disruptions

109
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.390
and successfully navigate change.

110
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.950
Understanding two key aspects

111
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.043
of change management can guide the way.

112
00:04:02.948 --> 00:04:04.130
The first function

113
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.170
of change management

114
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.090
is establishing a process.

115
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.100
This includes all the steps necessary

116
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.360
to guide an organization

117
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.591
through the phases of change.

118
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:14.390
Including recognizing the need for change,

119
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.010
proposing a change,

120
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.450
assessing readiness,

121
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.350
planning and implementing the change,

122
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.193
and ongoing monitoring of the changes effectiveness.

123
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.950
The second function of change management

124
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.470
is as a competency

125
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.280
and includes everything necessary

126
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.300
to guide people through change.

127
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.380
This is often referred

128
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.910
to as the people side of change.

129
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.810
Empowering employees to embrace change

130
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.900
through communication, support, and training

131
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.200
are important components of change management.

132
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.490
Let's face it.

133
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.200
In work, as in life,

134
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.850
change is inevitable.

135
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.240
Despite knowing that change

136
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.730
is always around the corner,

137
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.080
it can still induce anxiety,

138
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.140
insecurity and fear.

139
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.649
A framework for change management

140
00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.390
can mitigate the risks

141
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.250
and negative emotions

142
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.160
associated with change.

143
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.620
Let's take a look at some benefits

144
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.418
of change management.

145
00:05:03.418 --> 00:05:06.220
First, change management increases

146
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.820
the likelihood of a successful change.

147
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.770
Research indicates that nearly half

148
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.250
of organizational changes

149
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.790
result in failure,

150
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.960
but organizations that apply change management

151
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960
practices fare much better.

152
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.950
Why?

153
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.100
Because a planned approach

154
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.620
allows organizations to be proactive

155
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.940
instead of reactive

156
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.810
and avoid common obstacles

157
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.490
like low adoption rates,

158
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.180
employee resistance and wasted resources.

159
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.710
Second, being prepared for change

160
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.940
prevents an organization

161
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.890
from becoming stagnant.

162
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.999
In today's rapidly changing marketplace,

163
00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.770
organizations must be willing

164
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.829
and agile to embrace change.

165
00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:44.538
Failing to prepare for change

166
00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:46.433
may result in missed opportunity.

167
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.850
Finally, change management

168
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.320
can improve morale during transitions.

169
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.270
Being blindsided by change

170
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.870
or not having enough information to

171
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.400
understand its purpose

172
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.970
can create feelings of unease

173
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.270
and uncertainty for employees.

174
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.650
Effective change management

175
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.570
includes communication strategies,

176
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.740
and the support and resources necessary

177
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.070
to guide people through change

178
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.943
in a healthy way.

179
00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:13.090
Mismanaged change can cause heart feelings,

180
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.570
confusion and even chaos.

181
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.568
The only certainty is that change will come

182
00:06:17.568 --> 00:06:19.840
and organizations ready to meet it

183
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.010
with a robust change management plan

184
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.263
will have a far better chance of success.
