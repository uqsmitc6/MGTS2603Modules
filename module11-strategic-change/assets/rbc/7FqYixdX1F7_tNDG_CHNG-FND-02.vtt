<v ->Whether your company wants to implement</v>

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.670
a new sales technique

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.750
or plans a complete business overhaul,

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.390
chances are the organization will benefit

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.500
from a change management plan.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.460
But did you know there are types of change

7
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.910
that share similarities and significant differences?

8
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.360
Understanding these organizational change scopes

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.010
and their impact can help your team navigate them

10
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.543
to better achieve your goals.

11
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.410
Let's explore three types of organizational change

12
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.400
that you may experience.

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.140
The first type is developmental change.

14
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.470
It typically builds on

15
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.470
or improves current organizational practices or offerings.

16
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.373
Developmental change is the least disruptive change type.

17
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.930
Developmental change is rooted in skill

18
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510
and process building.

19
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.390
For example, a company might update software

20
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.520
or a product to a newer version,

21
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.900
add additional staff to an existing role,

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.813
or adapt their marketing strategy.

23
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.210
Next up is transitional change.

24
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760
It's more significant in scope

25
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.713
and usually involves a detailed plan to achieve goals.

26
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.870
The third and final type is transformational change.

27
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.000
Of the three change types, this is the most turbulent.

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.960
Hallmarks include a strong core visionary goal,

29
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.770
but the path to achieving the change is more ambiguous

30
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.463
and may require trial and error.

31
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.670
So while transitional change is large in scope,

32
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490
think mergers and acquisitions,

33
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.970
replacing one technology with a new one,

34
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.120
or adding a completely new product.

35
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.113
The path is laid out and structured.

36
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.370
Transformational change is also large scope, but iterative.

37
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.790
It can require an entirely new cultural

38
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.280
or behavioral standard

39
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.040
and therefore it's often fraught with emotion and stress.

40
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.390
For example, imagine pivoting

41
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.950
to a totally new operational model, business model

42
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.223
or company identity.

43
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.190
The scope and impact of these organizational change types

44
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.780
may differ, but these tips will help your team

45
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.380
make it through.

46
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.240
First, begin with an end in mind.

47
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.640
Establish a goal or vision and ensure everyone understands

48
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.860
where you're headed.

49
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.020
The map may look different

50
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.933
depending on the scope and style and that's okay.

51
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.620
Second, don't ignore emotions.

52
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.800
Even small changes can give rise to resistance.

53
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.450
Acknowledge and empathize with your team's experience

54
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.690
and you're more likely to keep them engaged.

55
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.020
Finally, increase buy-in by communicating the reasons

56
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.940
for the change

57
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.380
and getting team members involved as early as possible.

58
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.130
Understanding and believing in the change

59
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.520
helps with motivation and stamina,

60
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.143
especially when the path is long or unclear.

61
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.700
Organizational change depends on understanding the endeavor

62
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.050
and adapting leadership accordingly.

63
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.010
No matter the scope, a clear vision, communication process

64
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.540
and empathy will bring the team together to achieve goals,

65
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.750
especially when they believe

66
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.970
it's in everyone's best interest.

67
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.620
Try these tips to help your team

68
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.993
navigate the process more effectively and achieve success.
