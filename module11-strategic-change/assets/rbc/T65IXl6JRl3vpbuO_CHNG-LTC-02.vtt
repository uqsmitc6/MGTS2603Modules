<v ->How do you handle change as a manager?</v>

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.270
Do you jump at the chance

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.540
to introduce something new to your team?

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.870
Or does the thought of change bring up negative feelings?

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.290
The truth is that change will happen in our workplaces.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.030
Though it can be uncomfortable,

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.250
it is how we make our businesses and teams better.

8
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.880
Change is inevitable, but you don't have to see it

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.600
as a bad thing.

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.470
As a manager, how can you effectively lead your team

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.790
through change?

12
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.483
Let's go over some strategies.

13
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.770
Many issues that managers encounter

14
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.910
have to do with communication.

15
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.200
How do you handle miscommunication?

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.720
What do you do when rumors

17
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.793
and misinformation upset your team?

18
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.580
It's essential to keep communication open.

19
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.460
As a manager, you're in a position

20
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.690
to distribute information clearly.

21
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.930
You can explain to employees why a change is necessary,

22
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.350
how it affects everyone, what roles each person will play,

23
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.310
and how they will benefit.

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.710
Another related challenge is a lack of feedback

25
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.070
from your team.

26
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.610
How can you ensure communication happens both ways?

27
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.540
This is why it's essential to create

28
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.290
a psychologically safe work environment.

29
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.470
When your team feels safe, they're more likely

30
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.963
to communicate clearly and commit to change.

31
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.060
What does safety look like in a workplace?

32
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.100
People wanna feel heard, valued, and understood.

33
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.200
While every team and leader is unique,

34
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.040
respect should always be a priority.

35
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.243
Earn your team's commitment by being open and genuine.

36
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.250
So what do you do when an employee is open with you

37
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.050
and they don't want to change?

38
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.000
Some leaders might respond with defensiveness or authority

39
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.100
but consider embracing resistance instead.

40
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.040
When an employee disagrees with you,

41
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.130
you have the opportunity to an alternative perspective.

42
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.260
Perhaps they see something you don't

43
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.850
or maybe they need support in a way you haven't anticipated.

44
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.410
Resistance can be uncomfortable, but it also opens doors

45
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.000
for new information and rapport building with your team.

46
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.680
Let's say your team is excited about change

47
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.060
so much so that you jump into multiple transitions

48
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.200
only to find yourselves completely overwhelmed.

49
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.080
Have you experienced this?

50
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.360
How can you preemptively address team burnout?

51
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.733
The answer is to manage expectations early with your team.

52
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.270
Too many transitions at once

53
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.730
can cancel out the benefits of change.

54
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.000
As a leader, set reasonable objectives for your team

55
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.480
and keep everyone on the same page.

56
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.884
Also, encourage employees to prioritize

57
00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:37.083
their mental health and wellbeing.

58
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910
Managing expectations can help keep your team

59
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.010
from feeling exhausted by multiple changes.

60
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.560
Leadership means keeping in touch with employees

61
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.830
and staying aware of how they respond to transitions.

62
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.620
But what about if you, the manager are feeling burned out?

63
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.693
What kind of strategies can you use?

64
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.960
This is why it's essential to remember your role.

65
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.130
You can't control every aspect of change

66
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.320
or how your employees feel about it

67
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.600
but you can control how you support your team

68
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.400
and lead your collective response to change.

69
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.470
Remember as you encourage your team

70
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.150
to maintain their mental health

71
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.220
you are also responsible for your own wellbeing.

72
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.250
Change is difficult for everyone,

73
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.973
don't forget to care for yourself.

74
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.790
Change can be exciting and inspiring.

75
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.160
It's a key ingredient to making progress in your work.

76
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.590
Next time your team encounters a change,

77
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.790
think of yourself as a leader, a guide and a cultivator.

78
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.700
You and your team are growing together

79
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.180
and you have a unique role to play

80
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.793
as their manager and leader.
