<v ->When significant change happens in an organization,</v>

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.140
it doesn't just affect everyone at once.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.100
Often, it unfolds as a continual process

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.300
that can benefit from foresight and careful planning.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.050
Following a few best practices

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.843
can help us navigate changes with greater ease.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.280
So, what are some specific benefits

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.410
of applying best practices in change management?

9
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.110
First, it could prevent chaos.

10
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.720
A thoughtful introduction of change

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.040
is better than an unplanned initiation

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.990
that can seriously disrupt routines

13
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.200
and expectations in unproductive ways.

14
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.700
Second, it helps maintain relationships.

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850
Launching change without proper preparation

16
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.020
and communication can leave people feeling annoyed, ignored,

17
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.430
or worse, insulted.

18
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.200
Third, it fosters unity.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.280
Being mindful of best practices helps create buy-in

20
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.403
and participation from those involved.

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.770
To get the best results,

22
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.580
examine what principles you're following

23
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.983
as you roll out a change.

24
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.250
Now, let's look at some of the principles you can apply.

25
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.910
Here are five best practices in change management.

26
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.470
First, lay out the vision.

27
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.520
Communicate why the change is happening

28
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.220
and the ultimate goal you wish to achieve.

29
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.620
Support this vision with data and information

30
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.600
to bring people up to speed.

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.620
For example, if you share data

32
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.790
showing that adding a new product will help the bottom line,

33
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.870
people might understand the change more.

34
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.010
Second, build the structure for change.

35
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.830
Don't leave people feeling unsupported

36
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.210
as they undergo the transformation.

37
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.000
Let them know what to expect down the road.

38
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.930
Ask yourself, do they know the timeframe for this change?

39
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.850
What are some parameters that can guide people

40
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.163
in the right direction?

41
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.530
Third, prioritize resources.

42
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.293
Dedicate the right people and systems to the task.

43
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.940
To prevent things from falling through the cracks,

44
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.420
create a resource for people to ask questions

45
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.400
and express concerns,

46
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.333
and make sure they know where to find available resources.

47
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.930
Next, create a communication loop.

48
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.440
Repeated communication and frequent updates

49
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.280
can smooth out the process.

50
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.430
This is especially true if things move quickly.

51
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.110
Rather than practicing top-down communication,

52
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.860
create a loop so that information flows in both directions.

53
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.250
This will also keep you aware

54
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.603
of how employees are implementing changes.

55
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.100
Finally, support the stakeholders.

56
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.580
As early as possible,

57
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.420
inform those most affected by the change.

58
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.330
Acknowledge their input and value

59
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.410
by involving them in the process,

60
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.130
even if it's as simple as asking

61
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.880
what they need to feel supported during the transition.

62
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.150
Thoughtful consideration can go a long way

63
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.280
toward preventing the headaches and mistakes

64
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.670
that can happen when a change takes place.

65
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.710
Creating a solid structural foundation for the process

66
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.540
reassures all parties involved

67
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.173
and helps ensure the change is applied effectively.
