00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.470
<v ->Think back on your life.</v>

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.410
When have you made a major change?

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.690
And at what point did that change feel normal?

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.550
We're hardwired to adapt,

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.550
but that doesn't mean it happens instantly.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.210
For most of us, change is gradual.

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.370
We make a plan, experience unsteadiness,

8
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.260
and eventually, adjust.

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.340
The same thing happens with company-wide changes.

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.850
And one of the best strategies

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.450
for understanding and applying this concept

12
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.840
is Lewin's Change Management Model.

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.610
Let's define Lewin's Model,

14
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.513
unpack its benefits, and discover how to use it.

15
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.390
Kurt Lewin's 3-Step Model

16
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.350
is a classic framework for managing company change.

17
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.180
The model uses the analogy of reshaping an ice cube

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.940
into a cone.

19
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.790
First, you must melt or unfreeze the ice

20
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.980
so that it's amenable to change.

21
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.000
In the same way,

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.890
companies unfreeze current processes.

23
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.110
Next, the ice melts and changes shape.

24
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.310
Similarly, a company reshapes itself

25
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.040
and enters an unstable transition state.

26
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.270
Finally, the ice water refreezes and the change solidifies.

27
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.853
For companies, this phase signifies a return to stability.

28
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.220
Lewin's 3-Step Model illustrates

29
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.570
how companies can reshape the status quo

30
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.850
by unfreezing existing conditions,

31
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.163
implementing a change, and refreezing operations.

32
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.480
So, what are the benefits of Lewin's Model?

33
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.240
For one, it's easy to understand.

34
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.440
It breaks down unwieldy changes into a simple framework

35
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.800
that companies can readily adopt.

36
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.210
Second, it gets people on board

37
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.740
by emphasizing employee motivation as a driving contributor

38
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.860
to a successful change.

39
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.310
Third, by unfreezing the status quo

40
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.280
before implementing a change,

41
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.570
the model prepares employees to get ready

42
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.233
for the official game day.

43
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.430
Finally, this model helps companies

44
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.670
create changes that stick.

45
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.210
We see this with the final refreeze stage,

46
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.280
which stresses the need to embed changes

47
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.763
into company routines.

48
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.010
Lewin's Model is a helpful framework

49
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.720
for instituting change if you're able to invest the time.

50
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.370
Status quo shifts don't happen overnight,

51
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.370
so this framework is most beneficial

52
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.913
for large-scale changes.

53
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.120
Let's break down how to apply Lewin's 3-Step Model

54
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.670
to your company.

55
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.300
We begin by unfreezing current processes

56
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.900
and preparing employees for the upcoming transition.

57
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.380
Unfreeze the status quo by first defining the change.

58
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.950
What's going to happen?

59
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.500
Why is this necessary?

60
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.460
And whom will it impact?

61
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.780
Next, gather support from company leaders and stakeholders.

62
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.890
Change is a company-wide endeavor

63
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.800
and you'll need leaders to drive things forward.

64
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.160
Once you have support,

65
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920
bring employees into the loop.

66
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.330
Share a compelling message and maintain transparency

67
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.350
by explaining what's going to change,

68
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.970
how that will impact teams,

69
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.010
and why the change is a good thing,

70
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.460
both from a company and individual perspective.

71
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.940
Finally, take time to address uncertainties.

72
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.290
Resistance is common,

73
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.930
and employees need space to ask questions,

74
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.733
raise concerns, and get familiar with the plan.

75
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.780
The first stage of Lewin's Model

76
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.270
is all about melting the ice

77
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.660
and getting people ready to transform.

78
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.060
Once employees are motivated and prepared,

79
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.173
it's time to put the plan into action.

80
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480
After unfreezing the status quo,

81
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.820
deploy the change and guide teams forward

82
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.850
by following these tips.

83
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.270
First, communicate often.

84
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.210
Employees should have opportunities to give feedback,

85
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.920
ask questions, and share updates.

86
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.590
And leadership should avoid rumors

87
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.530
by explaining how the change impacts operations,

88
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.740
answering questions, and regularly updating employees

89
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.230
on progress and roadblocks.

90
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.490
Next, provide support.

91
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.360
People need extra guidance as they learn the ropes.

92
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.770
Give employees access to a knowledge base and training,

93
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.440
and make sure everyone has someone

94
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.873
they can turn to for help.

95
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.490
Third, maintain morale

96
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.100
by celebrating what's good about the change.

97
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.547
Reinforce the change's benefits by highlighting individual

98
00:04:12.547 --> 00:04:14.860
and company-wide benefits.

99
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.710
Also, boost confidence and reinforce

100
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.423
a we're moving forward mentality by celebrating small wins.

101
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.180
Employees will need hand holding and encouragement

102
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.020
as they get used to new ways of doing things.

103
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.470
Eventually, however, performance will level out.

104
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.650
When that happens,

105
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.263
it's your cue to move forward.

106
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.680
Finally, it's time to anchor the change

107
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.900
and refreeze operations.

108
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.680
Begin by documenting official processes.

109
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.030
You might've made a few adjustments during the change stage.

110
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.310
Now that the adjustment period is over,

111
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.480
embed the change into your company culture

112
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.720
by updating training materials and documents.

113
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.150
Next, hold a celebration.

114
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.940
Instill a we did it mentality

115
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.983
by celebrating the change's success.

116
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.540
Third, give regular reviews.

117
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.470
Routinely check in with employees

118
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.420
to ensure that they're incorporating the change

119
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.690
into daily operation.

120
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.770
Finally, continue offering support.

121
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.900
Employees will have more confidence and knowledge

122
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.470
by the refreeze stage,

123
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.330
but that doesn't mean support should stop.

124
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.980
Help team members sustain the change

125
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.260
by listening to their needs

126
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.353
and offering guidance as necessary.

127
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.390
Lewin's Change Management Model

128
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.530
follows an intuitive, gradual process.

129
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.030
We prepare employees for the upcoming change

130
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.350
by unfreezing the status quo.

131
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.760
Then, we enter an insecure transition period,

132
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.640
helping employees through stumbles and empowering them

133
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.210
to push forward.

134
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.130
Finally, we sustain and reinforce a change

135
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.670
by refreezing operations.

136
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.190
Follow this simple framework

137
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.320
when implementing company-wide changes

138
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.880
and you'll lay the groundwork

139
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.203
for a successful, smooth transition.
