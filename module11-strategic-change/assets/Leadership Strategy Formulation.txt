Identifying the critical drivers of organisational success 
The first element involves identifying the key factors that are essential for achieving success in the organisation's business strategy. These drivers could be capabilities, competencies, or other resources that are necessary for executing the strategy effectively. By identifying these drivers, the organisation can focus its leadership development efforts on building the skills and capabilities that are most critical to achieving its goals.

Shaping a culture that provides the conditions for individuals to perform 
The second element of a leadership strategy is creating a culture that supports and enables high performance. This involves fostering a sense of shared purpose and values among employees, as well as creating an environment that encourages innovation, risk-taking, and continuous learning. By shaping the organisational culture in this way, leaders can help to create the conditions that allow individuals to perform at their best and contribute to the organisation's success.

Creating a strong and sustainable talent pipeline 
The third element of a leadership strategy is developing a talent pipeline that can sustain the organisation's performance over time. This involves identifying and developing high-potential employees, as well as ensuring that the organisation has a robust succession planning process in place. By investing in the development of its people, the organization can build a strong and sustainable talent pool that can drive its success in the long term.

Evolving the organisational design to best support execution on the business strategy 
The fourth element of a leadership strategy is designing the organisation in a way that supports the execution of its business strategy. This involves aligning the structure, systems, and processes of the organisation with its strategic objectives, as well as ensuring that the organisation is agile and adaptable in the face of changing market conditions. By designing the organisation in this way, leaders can create a structure that enables the organisation to execute its strategy effectively and achieve its desired outcomes.
