00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.920
<v ->How well do you handle your emotions?</v>

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.480
Are you at the mercy of them

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.960
or can you use them to your advantage?

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.680
And what about when it comes to others?

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.060
Can you recognize how the people around you are feeling?

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.030
Leaders with high emotional intelligence

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.750
are skilled at identifying, understanding,

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.980
and managing their emotions and the emotions of others.

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.920
They can tune into how they're feeling,

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.060
and regulate their reactions.

11
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.810
And with that self-understanding,

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.240
they can also better recognize and respond

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.300
to the feelings of others.

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.300
It's an important skill to have,

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.360
so let's take a look at the two categories

16
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.160
of emotional intelligence and why they're necessary

17
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.593
for leadership success.

18
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.130
The first category of emotional intelligence

19
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.370
is personal competence, which refers

20
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.700
to how well you recognize and manage your emotions.

21
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.870
It's made up of three elements:

22
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-motivation.

23
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.400
Self-awareness is being aware of your emotions,

24
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.320
it's recognizing your feelings,

25
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.230
understanding why they're happening,

26
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.413
and noticing how your thoughts and behaviors are affected.

27
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.300
Self-regulation refers to how well you handle your emotions.

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.310
It revolves around self-control, thinking before you act,

29
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.203
and maintaining resilience during difficult times.

30
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.780
Finally, self-motivation refers to your personal drive.

31
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.760
It's using your emotions as a mobilizing tool

32
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.033
to ensure you stick to your goals.

33
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.580
The second category of emotional intelligence

34
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.910
is social competence which helps you

35
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.800
build strong social relationships

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.923
and create meaningful interactions.

37
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.810
Social competence is defined as how well you recognize

38
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.090
and manage the emotions of others.

39
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.610
It involves two elements, empathy and social skills.

40
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.070
Empathy is understanding another's emotions,

41
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.910
it's looking outside your perspective

42
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.260
and seeing things from another's point of view.

43
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.510
Social skills refer to how well you interact with others,

44
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.910
it's taking your understanding of another's feelings

45
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.260
and using that knowledge to create positive interactions.

46
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.920
So, emotional intelligence is just as much

47
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.171
about knowing yourself as it is about knowing others

48
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.690
and it plays an essential role

49
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.860
in the quality of your leadership.

50
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.607
Here are four leadership benefits

51
00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:31.690
of high emotional intelligence.

52
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.530
The first leadership benefit of emotional intelligence

53
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.770
is that you're more likely to make objective decisions.

54
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.360
Emotion-filled decisions are often shortsighted and risky,

55
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.380
but if you can recognize your feelings,

56
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.323
you'll know when they're getting in the way of your actions.

57
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.250
Second, you can expect fewer blind spots

58
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.370
as you'll be more aware of your internal

59
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.530
and external reality.

60
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.930
When it comes to you, you'll think before you act

61
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.990
and be less likely to jump to conclusions.

62
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.110
And when it comes to others,

63
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.280
you'll notice when employees are struggling

64
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.030
and you'll know how to give them the support they need.

65
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.460
Third, your communication will be more effective,

66
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.920
you'll know how to control your emotions,

67
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.300
communicate constructive messages,

68
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.910
engage your staff's understanding,

69
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.350
plus when listening to your team,

70
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.690
you'll observe their reactions and be more likely

71
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.690
to understand where they're coming from.

72
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.020
Finally, a leader with high emotional intelligence

73
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.500
can improve workplace morale.

74
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.120
You can better gauge how subordinates are feeling

75
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.040
and address those emotions with kindness and warmth.

76
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.130
You'll understand the nuances of various situations

77
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.260
and bring positivity into the workplace,

78
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.853
thus boosting employee happiness.

79
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.490
To succeed as a leader,

80
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.920
you need more than just intellectual smarts,

81
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.700
you also need emotional intelligence.

82
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.460
So, keep the benefits in mind

83
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.830
and make an effort to start tuning into your emotions,

84
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.790
practicing self-regulation, and finding ways

85
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.550
to cultivate internal motivation.

86
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.730
Then, look outside yourself to develop empathy

87
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.880
and improve your social skills.

88
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.300
Follow these tips and you can reap long-term rewards

89
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.203
both inside and outside the office.
