00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.250
<v ->Social interactions can be complicated.</v>

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.610
You need to know yourself, understand others,

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.010
and know how to bridge those gaps.

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.300
In short, you need social skills.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.560
But what exactly are social skills,

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.770
and how can you develop them?

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.780
First, social skills refer

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.060
to how well you handle

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.720
and influence other people's emotions.

10
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.130
It's a skill that covers a lot of ground,

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.650
and it's defined by an ability

12
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.750
to tune into another's emotions,

13
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.770
move them into the desired direction,

14
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.353
and manage relationships.

15
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.900
Social skills cover a wide range of aptitudes

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.400
that can be a little confusing at first.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.350
So, to better understand this emotional competency,

18
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.123
we can break it down into seven hallmarks.

19
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.010
The first hallmark of social skills involves communication.

20
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.650
Communication skills enable you

21
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.770
to share your feelings

22
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.733
and understand the feelings of others.

23
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.150
Next, there's collaboration and cooperation,

24
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.410
which refers to how well you work with others

25
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.280
so that conversations are productive and inclusive.

26
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.410
Third, there's persuasion and influence,

27
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.580
which is the ability to win people over

28
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.230
and convince them that they want to do what you want.

29
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.860
Fourth, there's inspirational leadership,

30
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.933
which is the ability to motivate and inspire others.

31
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.610
Fifth, there's the ability to manage conflicts

32
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.040
by creating solutions that everyone can agree on.

33
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.000
Next, there's the ability

34
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060
to develop and maintain relationships

35
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.640
by having meaningful conversations.

36
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.640
And finally, there's change management,

37
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.750
which is the ability to help others feel excited about,

38
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.840
rather than fearful of, change.

39
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.020
For leaders, social skills are essential.

40
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.810
And through practice,

41
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.480
you can enhance your social skills

42
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.060
by improving your expertise

43
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.190
in each of those seven hallmarks.

44
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.023
Here's how.

45
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.380
First, to enhance your communication skills,

46
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.930
share clear messages by being straightforward and sincere.

47
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.990
Listen actively by giving others your full attention,

48
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.480
and ask open questions

49
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.980
so that you can learn more about others.

50
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.040
Next, to improve collaboration and cooperation,

51
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.340
make sure everyone starts on the same page

52
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.523
by clarifying roles and defining objectives.

53
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.460
Then, to ensure ongoing cooperation,

54
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.230
celebrate each person's individuality,

55
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.410
encourage open-minded communication,

56
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.863
and express your appreciation for others.

57
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.930
To persuade and influence others,

58
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.230
start by formulating a clear argument

59
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.930
and developing a compelling reason

60
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.410
that appeals to your conversation partner's emotions.

61
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.060
Then, practice assertive communication

62
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.663
when delivering that message.

63
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.780
Fourth, to be an inspirational leader,

64
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.540
communicate a motivating company purpose

65
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.610
and unlock your team's potential

66
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.720
by appealing to each person's motivators.

67
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.390
Then, keep spirits up

68
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.420
by complimenting individual employees on their progress

69
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.383
and giving them some autonomy.

70
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.410
Inspirational leaders give

71
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.660
their employees individualized attention.

72
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.390
They recognize the person behind the job,

73
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.700
listen to their staff,

74
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.210
and emotionally empower their teams.

75
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.260
And that same attention can also come in handy

76
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.440
when managing conflicts.

77
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.690
To manage conflicts effectively,

78
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.460
start by, first, identifying

79
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.480
and dealing with each person's emotions.

80
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.610
Then, once everyone is in a stable state,

81
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.310
identify the conflict to make sure

82
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.170
there's no miscomputation, propose solutions,

83
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.670
and try to reach a conclusion

84
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.760
that meets everyone's underlying concerns.

85
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.560
Next, to develop and maintain relationships,

86
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.070
demonstrate a sincere interest in others

87
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.730
through active listening.

88
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.040
Also, communicate with empathy

89
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.250
to form connections and inject humor

90
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.270
into conversations, when appropriate.

91
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.650
Finally, to manage change,

92
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.560
start by explaining the need for that change.

93
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.250
Why is it necessary,

94
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.380
and what will people gain?

95
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.160
Next, listen to your employees' concerns

96
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.450
and fix what you can fix based on that feedback.

97
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.280
Then, to create a more seamless transition,

98
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.370
spend time training and preparing your staff

99
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.070
before making that change official.

100
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.330
There's a lot that goes into

101
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.110
perfecting your social skills,

102
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.280
and it doesn't happen overnight,

103
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.530
so keep practicing.

104
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.250
Remember the tips we covered,

105
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.400
and you'll start having better interactions,

106
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.883
both in and outside the workplace.
