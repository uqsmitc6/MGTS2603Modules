00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.210
<v ->We all live within our own realities.</v>

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.850
On a typical day, we tend to think about what we need,

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.330
how we're feeling and what we expect from others.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.690
But if we want to connect with someone else,

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.930
we need to consider what it might be like

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.400
to be in their place and that requires empathy.

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.960
Empathy is a core component of emotional intelligence

8
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.400
and it's a skill that's well worth developing.

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.950
So let's take a look at what empathy is,

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.060
why it's necessary and how you can develop it.

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.650
First, empathy gets confused with sympathy,

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.760
but there's a clear distinction.

13
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.680
Sympathy is feeling pity for someone.

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.157
It's acknowledging their emotions and saying,

15
00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:49.917
"I feel sorry for you."

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.230
Empathy, on the other hand,

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.190
is understanding someone's emotions.

18
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.010
It goes beyond recognition

19
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.960
and asks that you consider someone's perspective

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.143
as if it were your own.

21
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.470
To experience empathy,

22
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.560
you need to imagine yourself in someone else's place

23
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830
and tap into how they're feeling.

24
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.340
For leaders, that's a crucial skill

25
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.230
that leads to several benefits.

26
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.550
The first benefit of developing empathy

27
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.250
is that it promotes open communication.

28
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.970
When speaking empathetically,

29
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.850
you can fine-tune your message to fit a person or situation.

30
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.530
And when listening,

31
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.650
empathy helps you put aside your thoughts

32
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.450
and pay attention to what someone else is trying to say.

33
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.770
Second, empathy increases productivity.

34
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.870
Rather than offering guidance based on your assumptions,

35
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.350
it helps you understand exactly what others need

36
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.823
to boost their success.

37
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.190
Third, empathy cultivates employee trust.

38
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.890
It shows your employees that you're aware of their feelings

39
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.770
and will take those emotions into consideration.

40
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.520
In turn, your employees feel free to let their guard down

41
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.920
since they know their needs won't be overlooked.

42
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.860
And fourth, empathy boosts morale

43
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.123
as it helps your staff feel respected, safe, and heard.

44
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.200
So how can you develop empathy for your staff?

45
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.470
Here are five tips.

46
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.600
The first tip for developing empathy

47
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.930
is to practice active listening.

48
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.990
Rather than interpreting

49
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.370
or thinking about you're going to say next,

50
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.130
focus on the speaker.

51
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.340
Pay careful attention to the emotion behind their words.

52
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.800
Notice their body language

53
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.540
and try to connect with their feelings.

54
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.280
Second, be present and unplug.

55
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.050
When another person is speaking,

56
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.320
give them your full undivided attention.

57
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.550
Put down the technology

58
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.220
and don't gaze off into the distance.

59
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.010
Third, get curious and ask questions.

60
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.430
Rather than making assumptions, ask clarifying questions

61
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.130
and try learning as many details as you can.

62
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.810
The more you know, the more likely you are to understand

63
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.773
the full picture of another's reality.

64
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.860
Fourth, if an employee is struggling with a specific task,

65
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.890
you can also literally put yourself in their place.

66
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.900
Let your staff member walk you through what they're doing

67
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.810
and how they're struggling.

68
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.470
That will allow you to understand their pain better

69
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.210
and come up with a solution.

70
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.350
And finally, focus on relating to feelings

71
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.960
rather than events.

72
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.760
Everyone experiences things differently

73
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.560
and your interpretation of an event

74
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.940
might be very different than someone else's.

75
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.300
So pay attention to the resulting feelings and ask yourself,

76
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.953
can I relate to that emotion?

77
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.710
Empathy is a skill that takes some practice,

78
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.730
but it's worth the commitment.

79
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.040
So remember these tips

80
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.190
and make an effort to have those deeper conversations.

81
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.110
The more interactions you have,

82
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.990
the more likely you are to understand

83
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.540
what your employees are thinking and feeling.

84
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.123
And that's what empathy is all about.
