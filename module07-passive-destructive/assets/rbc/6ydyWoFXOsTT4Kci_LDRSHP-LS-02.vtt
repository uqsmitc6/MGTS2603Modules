00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.070
<v ->What does it mean to be Laissez-Faire leader?</v>

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.480
In French, the term translates to let them do

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.000
and that's largely how these leaders operate.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.700
It's a hands-off approach

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.280
based on trust, autonomy, and freedom.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.730
So let's take a look at the details of this style

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.053
and when it works best.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.960
To start, there are several key features

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.990
associated with the Laissez-Faire framework.

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.510
First, with little overhead,

11
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.070
policies will be relaxed

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.270
and staff can complete their responsibilities

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.010
however they see fit.

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.810
Second, after goals are communicated,

15
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.240
teams can expect minimal interference

16
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.470
as leaders rarely get involved in day-to-day operations.

17
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.640
Third, people who work for Laissez-Faire leaders

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.260
are expected to spot upcoming roadblocks

19
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.820
and solve problems on their own.

20
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.170
And fourth, team members have decision-making freedom.

21
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.820
Employees can create their own processes,

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.210
set their own deadlines,

23
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.460
and take action without checking in with others.

24
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.740
Laissez-Faire leaders

25
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.290
flip traditional power dynamics on the head.

26
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.760
They transfer control to their teams and stay out of the way

27
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.093
and that can lead to both benefits and drawbacks.

28
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.810
As a benefit, you can expect faster decision making

29
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.590
because staff are free to move forward

30
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.090
immediately after deciding on an action plan.

31
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.580
Second, you'll note that the freedom and independence

32
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.840
which accompany a Laissez-Faire style

33
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.270
can increase job satisfaction.

34
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.290
Employees can work however they feel most comfortable

35
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.893
and that improves morale.

36
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.860
And a third benefit is improved creativity and innovation.

37
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.540
Rather than operating under a single vision,

38
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.390
staff members are free to think differently.

39
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.110
They have the space to come up with their own solutions

40
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.003
and that improves the potential for innovation.

41
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.790
Of course, a lack of managerial control

42
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.230
can also lead to drawbacks.

43
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.490
When used in the wrong settings,

44
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.010
Laissez-Faire leadership may promote missed deadlines,

45
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.590
poor performance and low accountability.

46
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.560
First, missed deadlines might happen

47
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.690
if your staff struggles with self-discipline

48
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.883
and time management.

49
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.250
With no overhead structure,

50
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.140
these employees may find it challenging to stay on track.

51
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.420
Second, if your team is inexperienced or low skilled,

52
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.360
they may show poor performance

53
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.480
since such employees often require

54
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.990
clear directions and guidance.

55
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.190
And finally, with minimal overhead,

56
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.190
your subordinates may experience low accountability.

57
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.180
Staff members may question

58
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.240
where their responsibilities begin and end.

59
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.980
And they might use those ill-defined roles

60
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.223
as an excuse to avoid responsibility.

61
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.660
So how can you promote the benefits and avoid the drawbacks?

62
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.380
The answer comes down to your environment, goals,

63
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.510
and team's capability.

64
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.193
A Laissez-Faire style thrives in the following situations.

65
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.650
One, your staff must be skilled at self-management.

66
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.230
When group members are self-starters with high motivation,

67
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.020
a Laissez-Faire style can produce excellent results.

68
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.490
Two, your team should be highly knowledgeable.

69
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.970
If you're working with intelligent experts,

70
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.690
it's best to give them the space to work how they see fit

71
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.420
since that freedom allows them to flex their skills

72
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.990
and propel your company forward.

73
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.110
Three, this framework tends to work best

74
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.850
in creative environments.

75
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.190
In such situations,

76
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.410
you want to give employees the time and space

77
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.540
to collect their thoughts, allow them to experiment,

78
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.580
and they'll come up with more creative ideas.

79
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.860
And finally, Laissez-Faire leadership is helpful

80
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.920
if you're working at a fast-moving company

81
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.840
as your team will benefit from being able to pivot quickly.

82
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.810
Plus, if rapid decisions must be made,

83
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.830
the autonomy that comes with this framework

84
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.663
can free up the process.

85
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.210
If you've decided that a Laissez-Faire approach is best,

86
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.340
keep in mind that you can't leave your employees stranded.

87
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.693
You still need to set them up for success.

88
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.370
Make sure staff have the right resources,

89
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.700
training and information to get started.

90
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.400
Then, take a step back, but act as a mentor.

91
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.210
Give the group the freedom to work independently,

92
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.623
but also communicate that you're there to help.

93
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.900
Remember these tips and keep the pros and cons in mind

94
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.740
and a Laissez-Faire style can work great for your business.

95
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.430
Just be sure that you have a talented team of experts

96
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.233
pushing that initiative forward.
