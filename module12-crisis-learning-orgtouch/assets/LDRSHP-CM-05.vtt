00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.800
<v ->First of all, congratulations;</v>

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.910
you've survived a business crisis,

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.850
and that's no small feat.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.950
But before you get too comfortable,

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.720
remember that you're not out of the woods yet.

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.743
There's still a lot of work to do.

7
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.750
That's because no business

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.870
comes out of the crisis 100% unscathed.

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.560
Like a boulder that's been hurdled into company waters,

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.940
a crisis can create a ripple effect of damages

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.870
on your company's finances, customers,

12
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.560
reputation, operations, or staff.

13
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.500
Recovery takes time and effort,

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.563
and, here, you'll learn how to best focus those efforts.

15
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.220
But, first, let's start

16
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.480
with the basic definition

17
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.870
and goals of crisis recovery.

18
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.130
Recovery is the process

19
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.470
of returning to normal business operations

20
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.500
and rebuilding or recovering

21
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.900
what was lost due to a crisis.

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.950
It's the aftermath of a crisis,

23
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.100
when you clean up the mess.

24
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.360
There are five activities

25
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.660
that your recovery process

26
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.363
must entail to be effective.

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.313
The first one is to take care of the victims.

28
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.600
Follow up with the people

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.700
who were hurt or harmed by the crisis

30
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.660
by making sure they are out of danger.

31
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.810
Be ready to connect them

32
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.020
with counseling or support services,

33
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.070
and offer appropriate compensation

34
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.900
for damages caused by the company.

35
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.270
Ask yourself, what's the right thing

36
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.180
to do in this situation, then do it.

37
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.720
A genuine and generous approach to compensating victims

38
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.260
will help to restore your reputation.

39
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.180
It's also essential to continue

40
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.510
internal and external communications.

41
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.260
Provide all of the information

42
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.790
that you said you would during the crisis.

43
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.020
Maintain external communications

44
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.260
and give updates about what your company

45
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.123
is doing to take corrective action.

46
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.440
Also, don't forget to develop

47
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.740
an internal communications plan

48
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.660
to talk about the crisis with employees.

49
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.230
Don't minimize the incident's impact.

50
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.280
Instead, listen to employees' concerns,

51
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.310
and include them in conversations

52
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.560
about how to make impactful changes

53
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.173
in workplace policies or practices.

54
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.910
The third critical activity

55
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.440
is to develop a strategy

56
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.360
to repair your reputation.

57
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.860
Negative press, social media,

58
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.420
stories, and other forms of publicity

59
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.400
can linger in online search engines

60
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.160
well after the crisis is over.

61
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.230
Your team needs to develop a strategy

62
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.710
to counteract the negative content,

63
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.700
generate positive or valuable content

64
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.310
that's associated with your brand,

65
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.840
and rebuild your reputation.

66
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.573
Fourth is conducting a post-incident review, or PIR.

67
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.860
A PIR evaluates the factors

68
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.690
that contributed to a crisis,

69
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.000
what actions your team took

70
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.460
to respond to the crisis,

71
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.470
and the strengths and weaknesses of your response.

72
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.550
In other words, it gives you clarity

73
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.290
about what happened, why it happened,

74
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.703
how your company responded, and how you can improve.

75
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.170
Gather the members of your crisis response team

76
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.030
to identify strengths and weaknesses

77
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.730
in areas such as crisis prevention and preparation,

78
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.060
detection and notification,

79
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.460
assessment and mobilization,

80
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.553
and internal and external communications.

81
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.400
Finally, you must learn from past mistakes

82
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.530
and take correction action.

83
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.920
Use your PIR to help you brainstorm

84
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.860
improvements to make in areas, like prevention,

85
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.520
early warning systems, staffing,

86
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.450
insurance coverage, quality control,

87
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.010
finances, security, and others.

88
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.600
Approach the recovery phase

89
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.513
as an opportunity to learn, reevaluate, and grow.

90
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.970
Crisis recovery isn't about dwelling on the past,

91
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.410
it's about following up with the public,

92
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.590
following through with promises,

93
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.070
making things right, repairing damages,

94
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.650
and creating lasting, impactful changes.

95
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.530
Only then can you expect your company

96
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.483
to truly move forward and rise above a crisis.
