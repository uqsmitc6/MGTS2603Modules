00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.270
<v ->Have you ever packed an umbrella</v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.660
just in case it starts to rain?

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.040
Sure, the extra weight and space

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.860
the umbrella takes may be inconvenient,

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.520
but you know that it's worth the hassle

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.420
to avoid getting caught in a rainstorm with no protection.

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.680
This is a simple example of why

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.630
it's important to be prepared.

9
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.180
And getting caught in the rain

10
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.003
isn't even an outcome that's all that consequential.

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.110
Think about your business.

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.850
Instead of getting caught in the rain without an umbrella,

13
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.270
what would you do if you got caught in a scandal,

14
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.220
a public relations crisis or an emergency

15
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.260
without a plan or any sort of protection.

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.100
Investing in crisis prevention and preparation

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.640
is critical to protecting your business and public safety.

18
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.393
Here are four steps you can take to get ready.

19
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.050
First, form of crisis team.

20
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.330
This is a group of people who will be responsible

21
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.180
for your crisis prevention, preparation,

22
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.900
response and recovery efforts.

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.160
Ask yourself, what perspectives

24
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.933
or areas of expertise should be represented?

25
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.770
For example, you might include leaders

26
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.210
in executive management

27
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.940
and managers in human resources, public relations,

28
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.940
finance, operations and information technology.

29
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.920
The second step is twofold,

30
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670
is to understand and reduce your risk factors.

31
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.040
Start by bringing your crisis team together

32
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.070
to analyze what types of crises

33
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.693
are most likely to happen to your business.

34
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.200
Then brainstorm ways that you can reduce your risks

35
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.070
and prevent these crises from happening.

36
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310
For example, you might realize

37
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.360
that you're at high risk for a crisis

38
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.690
if something were to happen to a critical team member.

39
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.960
So, you might develop a training plan for that team member

40
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.510
to pass on their knowledge and skills

41
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.200
thus reducing the risks of a crisis.

42
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.340
While you can't eliminate all your risk factors,

43
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.950
focus on the risks that are most pressing

44
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.120
or most preventable.

45
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.410
Now, let's move on to a crucial step for preparation.

46
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.970
The next step is to develop a crisis response plan.

47
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.360
A crisis response plan details procedural guidelines

48
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.500
for managing information, activities,

49
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.600
operations and communications during a crisis.

50
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.480
Some of the key questions your crisis response plan

51
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.480
should cover include how will you

52
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.400
determine what's considered a crisis?

53
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.620
What's your plan for controlling information

54
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.810
and communicating the crisis to the public?

55
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.250
What are the different roles of your crisis team members?

56
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.830
And what are the resources and key contacts

57
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.373
for dealing with the crisis?

58
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.810
While you can't possibly plan everything

59
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.690
that needs to happen for a crisis in advance,

60
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.250
any legwork that you do now will save you

61
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.730
valuable time and potential harm later.

62
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.660
Finally, set up regular intervals to review,

63
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.813
practice and refine your crisis response plan.

64
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.210
Conduct training sessions, practice drill or mock exercises

65
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.870
and try to find holes in your crisis response plan.

66
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.050
Make updates when you discover areas

67
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.090
that could be improved or clarified.

68
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.500
It's easy to procrastinate or underestimate

69
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.920
the urgency of crisis prevention and preparation.

70
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.170
You may tell yourself, I'll deal with that if the time comes

71
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.590
but this reactive approach

72
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.320
is perhaps the greatest threat of all,

73
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.130
it leaves your team, your company and the public

74
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.813
vulnerable to serious harm and damage.

75
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.560
Adopt a proactive approach to crisis management instead,

76
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.770
by forming a crisis team,

77
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.240
understanding and reducing your risks,

78
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.253
developing a response plan and practicing it annually.
