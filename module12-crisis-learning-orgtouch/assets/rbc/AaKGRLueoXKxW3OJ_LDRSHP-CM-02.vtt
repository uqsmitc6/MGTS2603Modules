00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.240
<v ->What types of business crises are you are you at risk for?</v>

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.950
Is your data backed up?

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.400
Does your business disproportionately depend

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.300
on a few key clients?

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.330
How much financial runway do you have

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.580
before you're in trouble?

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.900
Understanding the different types of crises

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.830
that can happen is the first step

9
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.790
to identifying the types of crises

10
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.080
that are most likely to happen to you.

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.180
And once you know your risks,

12
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.940
you can then work to reduce and prepare for them.

13
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.910
So here are five types of business crises.

14
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.100
Review this list with your crisis team

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.270
and assess your own company's risks.

16
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.660
The first category is natural disasters and epidemics.

17
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.530
Natural disasters can wreak havoc on your equipment

18
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.380
or your building and potentially your employees' lives.

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.020
Outbreaks of illness or disease

20
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.090
can quickly incapacitate your workforce.

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.380
Examples of natural disasters are hurricanes and tsunamis,

22
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.380
tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and droughts.

23
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.560
Consider your geographic location and the likelihood

24
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.720
that you may face a natural disaster or epidemic.

25
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.570
What safety or insurance measures do you have in place?

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.750
The second type of crisis is financial.

27
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.640
Financial crises are events that may be catastrophic

28
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.760
to your company's finances or the vital resources

29
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.460
that you need to run the business.

30
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.730
A few examples of financial crises include strikes

31
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.270
or labor unrest, losing a major client or supplier,

32
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.110
market crashes, lawsuits, bankruptcy,

33
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.260
or even losing important leaders on your team.

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.210
Ask yourself and your crisis team what factors

35
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.180
could threaten your company's financial viability?

36
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690
What and who do you depend on for the company

37
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.620
to function and sustain itself?

38
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.730
Third is technological crises.

39
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.970
Technological crises are caused by human errors

40
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.650
in developing or using technology,

41
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.640
or they happen when a system

42
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.990
that your company depends on breaks down.

43
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.390
Technological crises have a high risk of harming the public

44
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.980
or the environment, and they're often caused

45
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.823
by mistakes made by the company.

46
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.660
Some examples include phishing, hacking, or cyberattacks,

47
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.140
mishandling of sensitive data,

48
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.780
critical equipment or software failures,

49
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.633
industrial accidents, and product defects or recalls.

50
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.930
Take a close look at what technologies you use and create.

51
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.360
What protocols and training do you have in place

52
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.860
to prevent accidents and mistakes?

53
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.053
What technology systems do you rely on to run smoothly?

54
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.030
The fourth type of crisis is organizational misdeeds.

55
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.410
Organizational misdeeds describe when management's actions

56
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.270
have a significant negative impact

57
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.993
on the public or business.

58
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.900
Crises caused by organizational misdeeds

59
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.100
include management misconduct,

60
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.130
which occurs when management engages in illegal behavior

61
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.670
such as accepting bribes, embezzlement, sexual harassment,

62
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.250
discrimination, or other those corporate crimes.

63
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.850
This also covers crises of deception,

64
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.700
which happens when management intentionally withholds

65
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.040
or misrepresents information to the public.

66
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.210
Carefully consider the power structures

67
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.760
and code of conduct you have in place at your company.

68
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.490
Is there a safe way for employees to report illegal

69
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.420
or unethical behavior about managers?

70
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.010
Finally, the last type of crisis is workplace violence

71
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.300
and acts of malevolence.

72
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.120
Example of workplace violence and acts of malevolence

73
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.410
include physical fights, workplace shootings,

74
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.170
kidnappings, acts of terrorism,

75
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.330
product tampering, or malicious rumors.

76
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.220
Consider the levels of tension that exist between employees

77
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.410
or the company and the public.

78
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.020
Does the political landscape or nature of your work

79
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.963
make you a potential target of an act of malevolence?

80
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.570
Crises can appear in a variety of forms.

81
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.290
Don't leave your business vulnerable to them.

82
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.310
Ask yourself, what could go wrong?

83
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.970
Be proactive about assessing your risk factors

84
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.670
and then work to reduce and prepare for them.

85
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.740
It's better to look ahead and take action

86
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.453
rather than look back and regret inaction.
