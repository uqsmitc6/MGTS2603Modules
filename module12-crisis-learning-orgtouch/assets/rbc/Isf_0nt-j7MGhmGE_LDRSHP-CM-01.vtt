00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.070
<v ->Industrial accidents, product recalls,</v>

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.700
lawsuits, natural disasters, market crashes.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.530
These are just a few examples of business crises

4
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.100
or unexpected and large-scale events

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400
that threaten the stability of your business.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.010
And if you think that your company

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.890
is immune to a crisis, then think again.

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.580
Crises strike companies of all sizes,

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.780
industries, and track records.

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.530
They can be difficult to predict,

11
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.340
and they're sometimes impossible to prevent.

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.140
So, how can you minimize

13
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.920
the potential damage of a crisis

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800
and prepare for the worst?

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.780
You can practice effective crisis management,

16
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.280
which you'll learn about next.

17
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.270
Crisis management is the process

18
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.220
of preventing, containing, and minimizing

19
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.603
the negative impact of a business crisis.

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.010
In other words, it's damage control,

21
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.483
and it can be broken down into three stages.

22
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.490
The first and most important stage of crisis management

23
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.513
is prevention and preparation.

24
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.520
Prevention and preparation take place

25
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.570
before a crisis happens.

26
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.350
Planning helps you to systemize crisis management

27
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.920
or make it routine.

28
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.300
A routine saves time

29
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.410
and reduces mistakes or missteps.

30
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.100
Prevention involves analyzing your risks,

31
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.820
identifying the types of crisis

32
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.770
your company is most vulnerable to,

33
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.373
and then taking steps to lower your risks.

34
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.320
Preparation involves building

35
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.450
and training a crisis team,

36
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.950
developing a crisis response plan,

37
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.653
and assigning roles in the event of a crisis.

38
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.640
Prevention will reduce your chances

39
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.270
of experiencing a crisis,

40
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.360
and preparation will equip your team

41
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.050
with the strategy, knowledge, and training

42
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.520
they need to respond effectively when a crisis strikes.

43
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.053
The second stage of crisis management is crisis response.

44
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.340
This stage takes place during a crisis.

45
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.870
It's how you coordinate efforts

46
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.273
to respond to and contain the crisis.

47
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.410
Responding to a crisis involves many steps.

48
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.960
For example, you need to recognize

49
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.793
that you're experiencing a crisis.

50
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.490
Assess the scope of its impact.

51
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.070
Take corrective action

52
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.230
or steps to contain the crisis.

53
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.300
And communicate with the public,

54
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.920
stakeholders, and employees.

55
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.200
The response stage of crisis management

56
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.600
is high pressure and high stakes.

57
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.900
Time is urgent, resources may be scarce,

58
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.350
and your actions may lose

59
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.550
or save your business, or even lives.

60
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.950
Again, that's why doing the legwork

61
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.000
in stage one is so important.

62
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.880
By reducing the chaos, you improve your outcomes

63
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.060
by having a crisis team,

64
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.220
plan, and protocols prepared.

65
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.600
Finally, the last stage of crisis management is recovery.

66
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.480
This is the aftermath of a crisis.

67
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.920
It takes place after the significant threats

68
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.850
of a crisis have been avoided,

69
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.073
minimized, or otherwise handled.

70
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.220
Recovery focuses on rebuilding your business,

71
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.440
reputation, and lost customers or profits.

72
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.750
Another critical component of recovery

73
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.910
is formally reviewing what you can learn from the crisis

74
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.750
and implementing business changes

75
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.123
to avoid similar situations in the future.

76
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.110
Altogether, effective crisis management

77
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.310
is comprised of three stages:

78
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.250
prevention and preparation,

79
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.960
response, and recovery.

80
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.340
You need all three stages

81
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.970
to take a comprehensive approach

82
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.500
to reducing the damage pre-crisis,

83
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.320
during a crisis, and post-crisis.

84
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.440
While you may like to think

85
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.690
that a crisis won't happen to you,

86
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.800
overconfidence can leave your company vulnerable.

87
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.170
Make the crisis management a priority

88
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.810
and put together a crisis team

89
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.200
to get started on crisis prevention and preparation.

90
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.103
It may just save your business.
