00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.550
<v ->Dealing with a business crisis can be chaotic,</v>

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.600
stressful, and downright painful.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.950
For example, how do you handle a major product defect?

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.931
What do you say to the customers who are rightly angry,

5
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.540
upset, or distrustful of your brand?

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.470
What do you do to make things right

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.093
and keep your doors open?

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.000
While the answers to these questions will vary

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.670
depending on the type and cause of the crisis,

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.493
here are some basic guidelines that you should follow.

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.410
First, you need to start by simply recognizing

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.420
that you're in a crisis.

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.940
That means you need to detect the early warning signs

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.070
of a crisis and alert the right people.

15
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.400
Recognizing a crisis is an essential step

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.143
for activating your company's crisis response mode.

17
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.170
Next, take a deep breath and a step back

18
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.820
to try and understand the problem.

19
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.320
What do you know?

20
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.860
What's the impact?

21
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.923
And what is the scope of the crisis?

22
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.590
Don't speculate or make assumptions about the situation.

23
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.190
Do your research or seek further information

24
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.573
to understand and list the facts.

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.490
So far, you know there's a problem,

26
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820
you've activated your crisis response team,

27
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.400
and you understand the facts.

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.043
Now it's time to make some moves.

29
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.050
Aim to communicate quickly,

30
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.660
issue a public statement as soon as you can,

31
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.310
ideally within an hour or two after you realize

32
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.120
that there's a crisis.

33
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.410
You need to get ahead of public communications

34
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.930
and take control of the narrative

35
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.810
that's being told about the event and your company.

36
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.573
Otherwise, someone else will.

37
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.890
As a general rule of thumb, be quick,

38
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.240
be honest, and be accurate.

39
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.850
Do not give information that isn't confirmed.

40
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.160
If you don't have all the facts yet,

41
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.440
simply say that you don't have all the facts yet.

42
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.530
Give regular updates across multiple communication

43
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160
and social media channels.

44
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.630
Finally, a crisis requires businesses

45
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.290
to take swift and effective action.

46
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.097
Your first priority must be to protect people.

47
00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:11.430
Are people in danger, and what can you do

48
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.610
to protect public and employee safety?

49
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.628
After public safety is secure,

50
00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:20.220
you can tackle other priorities including your business,

51
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.233
facilities, technology, and reputation.

52
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.020
Get your crisis team together

53
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.760
to assess the current damage and lingering threats.

54
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.980
Then decide what steps you can take

55
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.239
to contain and prevent further damage.

56
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.240
In summary, after a crisis hits,

57
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.420
you need to recognize the crisis,

58
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.910
understand the situation, communicate with the public,

59
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.490
and take corrective action.

60
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.590
Do share the facts, take responsibility for the situation,

61
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.720
and address victims or customers directly.

62
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.900
Always put public safety first

63
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.620
and be accessible for answering questions

64
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.920
and addressing concerns.

65
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.440
Don't speculate, lie, or distort the truth.

66
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.100
Also, don't blame others or disappear

67
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.763
in the aftermath of a crisis.

68
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.740
Follow these guidelines to help you

69
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.830
navigate a crisis effectively

70
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.823
and minimize its overall impact.
