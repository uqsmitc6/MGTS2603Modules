00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.550
<v ->Picture your perfect workplace culture.</v>

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.880
What do you see?

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.560
Are your employees smiling and supporting one another?

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.530
Do people enjoy coming to work

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.440
and are they engaged and motivated?

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.990
All of those qualities define a positive team culture,

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.300
and with the right strategy it's something you can create

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.810
within your team.

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.980
So how is that done?

10
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.920
First, let's dive into the characteristics

11
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.313
of a positive team culture as well as its benefits.

12
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.140
A positive team culture has

13
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.590
several tell-tale characteristics.

14
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.980
First, employees have a shared vision.

15
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.650
Within these cultures, everyone works

16
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.710
towards the same overarching goal.

17
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.140
Second, frequent communication is common

18
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.580
as people are comfortable speaking up,

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.510
and they don't shy away from feedback.

20
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.070
Third, employees share positive relationships

21
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.850
as they care for their colleagues

22
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.680
and treat one another with compassion.

23
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.950
Fourth, trust and respect are also high on the list

24
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.940
as employees are confident

25
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.063
and treat one another with dignity.

26
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.630
Fifth, team members take ownership

27
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.160
and accountability for their work.

28
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.750
And finally, people are motivated

29
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.723
and excited about their jobs.

30
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.370
When a team's culture aligns

31
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.870
with all those characteristics it leads

32
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.960
to numerous rewards, both on an individual

33
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.780
and company-wide level.

34
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.860
So, what are those rewards?

35
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.560
There are five primary benefits of a positive team culture.

36
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.850
First, employees experience less stress

37
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.760
since they know what they're doing and why they're doing it.

38
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.910
Also they can work in peace without fearing

39
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.700
that their coworkers will undermine them.

40
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.130
Second, employees display heightened engagement

41
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.030
since they feel supported and understand their part

42
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.493
in the larger team goal.

43
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.860
Third, company performance also improves

44
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.680
since individuals work together

45
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.970
to create well thought-out strategies,

46
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.860
and they remain committed

47
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.723
to putting their best foot forward.

48
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.890
Fourth, a positive team culture is a great selling point

49
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.040
for attracting top talent during recruitment.

50
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.180
And finally, you'll also see increased loyalty.

51
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.660
After all, if you help employees feel like you're invested

52
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.960
in their well-being, they'll be happier

53
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.693
and more loyal to you in return.

54
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.880
Companies with positive team cultures accomplish more

55
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.240
than others and deliver superior quality.

56
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.060
Also, these cultures can be built by any company

57
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.610
regardless of the size, industry, or budget.

58
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.913
So, how is that done?

59
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.020
There are four well-known strategies

60
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.770
for building a positive team culture.

61
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.240
First, create meaning for your employees.

62
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.530
Team members should understand the purpose of their work,

63
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.450
so reinforce your mission statement,

64
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.460
share company-wide goals,

65
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.260
and always give team members context

66
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.420
by explaining how their responsibilities contribute

67
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.340
to the larger goal.

68
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.350
Second, prioritize transparent communication.

69
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.200
Your team members should be kept in the loop

70
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.950
and feel comfortable sharing their thoughts,

71
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.610
so share updates and be approachable

72
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.420
with regular check-ins and an open-door policy.

73
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.253
Also, hold weekly meetings to prevent knowledge hoarding.

74
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.610
Of course transparent communication isn't only about you.

75
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.450
Your team members must feel comfortable speaking

76
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.320
to one another, which brings us to our third strategy.

77
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.180
The third strategy is to foster social connections.

78
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.200
Help your team members develop positive relationships

79
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.800
by allowing them to connect on a personal level.

80
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.470
Consider scheduling potlucks and weekly team lunches.

81
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.740
Celebrate milestones such as birthdays

82
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.860
and team accomplishments in the break room,

83
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.060
and organize team building activities.

84
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.410
Finally, to help your team members stay motivated,

85
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.460
promote learning and development.

86
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.010
Consider offering education courses,

87
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.760
scheduling frequent one-on-ones and feedback sessions,

88
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.460
and encouraging knowledge sharing

89
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.540
among your team members.

90
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.330
Building a positive team culture takes time, effort,

91
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.620
and commitment but it's not impossible.

92
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.560
So keep the benefits in mind

93
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.670
and follow those four strategies

94
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.720
as that consistent effort will make all the difference

95
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.593
when it comes to your team's happiness and success.
