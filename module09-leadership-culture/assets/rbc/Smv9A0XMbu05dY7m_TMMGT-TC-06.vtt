00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.330
<v ->Have you ever worked at a company</v>

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.230
where your mood instantly dropped

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.570
as soon as you walked into the door?

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.010
Did you spend your work days forcing smiles

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.260
and counting down the minutes until you could leave?

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.850
If so, you likely worked within a negative team culture.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.900
Negative team cultures can feel overwhelming.

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.200
But regardless of how bad things are,

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.550
you can still turn them around with the right strategy.

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.770
So how's that done?

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.570
You'll need to understand the symptoms

12
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.743
as well as how to alleviate them.

13
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.640
There are several tell-tale signs of negative team culture.

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.500
First, you may notice some overarching unhappiness,

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.360
including moments of employee frustration,

16
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.810
stress, anxiety, and burnout.

17
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.780
And with that unhappiness,

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.630
employees may also be unmotivated

19
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.720
and appear bored and apathetic.

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.300
Or they might even fear speaking up

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.680
and sharing their thoughts.

22
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.340
Also, rather than working together,

23
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.940
team members may show signs of unhealthy competition,

24
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.810
zero comradery, and even socially harmful behaviors

25
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.259
like gossiping or bullying.

26
00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.750
Finally, you may spot signs of top-down communication,

27
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.490
workplace favoritism, suspicion, and mistrust.

28
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.730
And ultimately, a higher turnover.

29
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.160
The more of those signs you notice within your organization,

30
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.100
the more likely it is you're working

31
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.300
within a negative team culture.

32
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.310
So, what can you do about that?

33
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.910
How can you transform a negative team culture

34
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.193
into a positive one?

35
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.700
To transform a negative team culture,

36
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.080
you'll wanna follow four steps.

37
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.860
First, identify what problems you're facing.

38
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.410
When following this step, keep in mind that our opinion,

39
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.920
while valuable, isn't enough.

40
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.910
So hold a team meeting.

41
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.800
Hear from everyone and come to a group consensus.

42
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.830
Next, uncover why those culture problems exist.

43
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.280
During this stage, dig a little deeper

44
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.210
to determine what shared policies, values,

45
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.690
and actions are supporting those toxic behaviors.

46
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.990
And to get the most accurate and honest assessment,

47
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.270
consider gathering that information

48
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.090
through anonymous employee surveys.

49
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.710
Now that you know what problems you're experiencing

50
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.250
as well as why those problems exist,

51
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.340
the next step is to tackle the issues head on,

52
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.700
which brings us to step three.

53
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.910
Step three is to create a repair strategy.

54
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.230
The strategy you choose should depend

55
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.140
on your team's diagnosis.

56
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.770
For example, if your team is experiencing

57
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.550
a discrimination problem,

58
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.980
you might focus on helping employees

59
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.990
build their emotional intelligence with courses,

60
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.550
workshops, and sensitivity trainings.

61
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.608
Another idea that you might try

62
00:02:56.608 --> 00:02:58.780
is adjusting your company policy

63
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.810
so that everyone is treated equally.

64
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.420
Or you may incorporate transparent communication policies

65
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.163
to reduce confusion and information hoarding.

66
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.490
You might also place an emphasis on encouraging cooperation

67
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.330
by giving more team-based assignments,

68
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.930
praising employees for working together,

69
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.150
and holding team-building activities.

70
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.890
Regardless of which strategies you choose,

71
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.140
compile that list and confirm with your team members

72
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.990
that you're all on the same page.

73
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.976
Then, move on to the final step.

74
00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:35.710
The last step is to implement your plan.

75
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.370
During this stage, don't try to fix everything at once,

76
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.760
as that may overwhelm your team.

77
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.150
Instead, tackle the biggest problems first.

78
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.210
Then once those strategies are in place,

79
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.620
move on to the smaller elements of your repair strategy.

80
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.140
No one wants to admit their team culture is negative,

81
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.590
but if that's the reality you're facing,

82
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.430
you must confront those problems

83
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.510
before they get out of control.

84
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.810
So meet with your team and follow the steps we just covered.

85
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.000
Also, be persistent, as that's the key

86
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.063
to turning things around for the better.
