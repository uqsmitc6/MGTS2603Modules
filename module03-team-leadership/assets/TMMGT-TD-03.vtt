00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.060
<v ->When you think of a high-performing team,</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.750
what's the first thought that comes to mind?

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.760
Do you imagine people getting along

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.570
and working well together?

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.010
Do you think of a group that just seems to get more done,

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.340
and with superior quality?

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.490
When it comes to high-performing teams,

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.030
there's often a case of you know it when you see it,

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.090
but beyond that vague understanding,

10
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.900
what makes these teams different?

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.290
To answer that question, let's dive

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.150
into the difference between a high-performing team

13
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.810
and an average team,

14
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.020
as well as what characteristics go

15
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.023
into making a high-performing team?

16
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:45.170
An average team is one that produces inconsistent results.

17
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.850
These groups may occasionally meet their expectations,

18
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.220
but overall people tend to be at odds with one another,

19
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.400
holding conflicting priorities, showing unequal effort,

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.920
and failing to communicate well.

21
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.090
A high-performing team, on the other hand,

22
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.480
is consistently excellent.

23
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.130
These groups work like a well oiled machine.

24
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.560
Together everyone reaches toward the same target,

25
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.400
shares responsibility, and supports one another.

26
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.050
A high-performing team works together

27
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.380
to achieve superior performance.

28
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.460
Of course, the next question is what ingredients do you need

29
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.883
to create such a team?

30
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.570
Six foundational characteristics underpin

31
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.030
a high-performing team's success.

32
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.100
First, these groups have a strong sense of purpose,

33
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.080
both on a team and on an individual level.

34
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.430
On a team level,

35
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.360
everyone understands what the group is aiming toward.

36
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.080
On the individual level,

37
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.510
each person is also aware of their role,

38
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.350
and how that supports the greater goal.

39
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.480
Second, high-performing teams share a culture

40
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.660
of open communication and transparency,

41
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.610
people express themselves freely and frequently,

42
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.330
and, as a result, everyone feels heard

43
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.610
and is aware of progress and developments.

44
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.710
Third, people share ownership and accountability.

45
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.050
Rather than taking it easy and letting others do the work,

46
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.220
high-performing team members share that burden.

47
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.240
Each person pulls their own weight

48
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.293
and feels accountable for what they do.

49
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.310
High-performing team members know what they must do

50
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.930
and how to do it.

51
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.570
They trust themselves to get the job done,

52
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.503
and are known for taking control.

53
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.780
But another characteristic of high-performing team members

54
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.280
is that they always trust and respect one another.

55
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.690
Rather than doubting each other's abilities,

56
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.980
they're confident in their fellow team members

57
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.620
and respect what each person brings to the table.

58
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.960
Also, high-performing teams have diverse skills

59
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.200
and perspectives.

60
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.790
Each person has a unique personality, background,

61
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.960
work style, experience, and viewpoint, and,

62
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.780
that combined diversity,

63
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.470
helps the group achieve a higher standard of excellence.

64
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.840
Finally, high-performing teams are also flexible

65
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.320
and adaptable.

66
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.200
They understand that if conditions change,

67
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.140
they must change as well,

68
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.850
and they stay on the lookout for better, faster,

69
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.500
and more effective ways of doing things,

70
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.313
thus continually improving and upping their output.

71
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.700
High-performing teams work together

72
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.830
to achieve more than any one person could.

73
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.830
As a leader,

74
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.890
your job is to keep these characteristics in mind,

75
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.590
and evaluate where your team stands.

76
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.690
So put aside any vague definitions

77
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.140
you might have about high-performing teams,

78
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.030
and use these characteristics as defining goalposts.

79
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.590
You know where you need to go,

80
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.870
you know what success looks like,

81
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.063
the next step is about getting there.
