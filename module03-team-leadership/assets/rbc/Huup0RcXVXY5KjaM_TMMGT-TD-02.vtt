00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.880
<v ->A movie set is a strong example</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.920
of the importance of team roles.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.910
On a film set, you can imagine

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.490
how different people play different parts.

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.620
For example, you need a director to provide creative vision,

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.760
a cinematographer to shoot the film,

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.910
and a producer to manage the logistics

8
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.540
and generally make things happen.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.380
Every role is essential to the success of the film.

10
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.510
If everyone wanted to be a director,

11
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.280
the film would never be shot or edited.

12
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.640
If no one wanted to take charge of audio,

13
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960
the film wouldn't be felt or experienced in the same way.

14
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.480
While these are formal roles on a set,

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.030
the need to clarify roles and create balance between them

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.623
still applies to informal roles, too.

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.870
Informal roles describe the team responsibilities

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.220
and contributions we tend to take on

19
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.470
as a result of our pattern of behavior

20
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.160
and our interpersonal strengths.

21
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.880
Whether you realize it or not,

22
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.710
your team members are naturally gravitating

23
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.880
toward specific roles.

24
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.870
According to Belbin's Team Roles,

25
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.160
which is one of the most accessible and widely used models,

26
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.403
there are nine common roles on a team.

27
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.120
The first three roles are the shaper,

28
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.470
implementer and completer-finisher.

29
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.110
These make up the action-oriented team roles

30
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.740
because they're all about getting things done

31
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.233
and taking action.

32
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.610
First up is the shaper.

33
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.270
A shaper challenges and drives the team

34
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730
to achieve its goals.

35
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.400
Shapers are typically high-energy, highly motivated

36
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.780
and headstrong individuals.

37
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.130
They're enthusiastic and dynamic leaders

38
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.050
who perform great under pressure

39
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.590
and inspire others to act.

40
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.180
Implementers, then, are the people who get things done.

41
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.470
They turn the team's ideas into practical steps

42
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.040
and action plans, and then complete them.

43
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.400
Implementers are typically well-organized,

44
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.870
consistent and reliable.

45
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.830
They have an outstanding work ethic

46
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.060
that the team can count on, and they rarely miss a deadline.

47
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.210
The last action-oriented role

48
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.766
is the completer, the finisher.

49
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.170
Completer-finishers serve to review the team's work

50
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.730
at the end of a project and polish it,

51
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.750
check it for details or correct mistakes.

52
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.740
It's not a surprise, then, to find that completer-finishers

53
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.520
are often accurate, detail-oriented

54
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.383
and thorough perfectionists.

55
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.100
The next three roles are people-oriented.

56
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.310
That means they revolve around taking care

57
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.390
of the company's most important asset, its people.

58
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.840
This includes coordinators, team workers

59
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.913
and resource investigators.

60
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.420
Coordinators manage the team's talent

61
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.260
and work to promote collaboration and consensus.

62
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.960
They're who you think of when you imagine team managers

63
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.470
in a traditional sense.

64
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.990
They're mature and collected individuals

65
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.590
who naturally excel at bringing a team together

66
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.230
to work towards shared goals

67
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.430
and coordinating that team's activities.

68
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.410
Team workers are next.

69
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.270
These are all-purpose members

70
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.600
who support others on the team wherever they need it.

71
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.580
Team workers are helpful, diplomatic and versatile.

72
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.370
They care about collective goals

73
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.600
and making sure that everyone feels supported.

74
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.550
People often like and respect team workers,

75
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.740
so they can also serve as the glue

76
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.300
that holds a team together,

77
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.770
or the mediator that diffuses conflict.

78
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.080
Third, resource investigators are ideal

79
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.290
for developing strategic relationships

80
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.890
and securing resources on behalf of the team.

81
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.970
Resource investigators are typically outgoing,

82
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.660
charming, affable, persuasive and enthusiastic.

83
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.630
That's why they make a great face for the company.

84
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.040
The team relies on its resource investigator

85
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.600
to generate enthusiasm, negotiate resources

86
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.763
and develop new contacts or partnerships.

87
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.370
The final three roles fall

88
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.670
under the thought-oriented category.

89
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.200
That means they deal with ideas and information,

90
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.770
plants, monitor-evaluators and specialists

91
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.180
are all considered thought-oriented roles.

92
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.720
First, let's talk about plants.

93
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.270
Plants help the team by brainstorming new ideas

94
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.940
or ways of doing things.

95
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.960
Creative, free-thinking and inventive,

96
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.870
plants are most likely to propel innovation,

97
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.900
spearhead original concepts or find new ways

98
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.920
to approach complex problems.

99
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.260
They think outside the box.

100
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.300
Next, monitor-evaluators are best at analyzing

101
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.760
and evaluating the ideas and suggestions of others,

102
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.260
such as plants.

103
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.050
They excel at weighing the strengths and weaknesses

104
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.830
of the team's options.

105
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.810
Teams rely on monitor-evaluators to make objective decisions

106
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.680
and to determine the feasibility of an idea

107
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.780
and develop it further.

108
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.140
The very last team role is the specialist.

109
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.510
Specialists offer specialized knowledge, skills

110
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.240
and technical expertise that are essential

111
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.180
to the success of the team.

112
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.030
They are incredibly knowledgeable, professional

113
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.083
and often eager to share their expertise with others.

114
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.210
As you reflect on your team's informal roles,

115
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.100
try asking yourself what roles do my team members play?

116
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.900
And how well am I using each team member's strengths?

117
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.740
Are there any roles missing?

118
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.470
Or is there an overlap between roles

119
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.270
that's creating tension?

120
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.070
From there, you can then decide how best

121
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.703
to balance your team and clarify team roles.
