00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.980
<v ->We've all sat through unproductive meetings.</v>

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.450
But if planned and executed properly,

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.120
meetings don't have to be a waste of time.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.210
They can drive our projects forward,

5
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.870
and help us realize our full potential.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.470
So how do you organize

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.948
and lead an effective project meeting?

8
00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:23.168
First, let's consider a meeting's purpose.

9
00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:25.160
All meetings are different,

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.530
but there's one thing they have in common.

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.320
They have an objective.

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.950
In project management, we never meet for the sake of habit.

13
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.303
Rather, a meeting is always a goal-oriented event.

14
00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.460
As the project manager,

15
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.140
you are the facilitator for these events.

16
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.320
That means defining the meeting's objective,

17
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.450
and leading the group toward achieving that purpose.

18
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.200
Facilitation is about organizing, guiding and following up.

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.380
So how can you organize

20
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.080
a successful meeting and arrive prepared?

21
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.153
You'll need to follow four steps.

22
00:00:57.153 --> 00:00:59.933
First, define the meeting objective.

23
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:03.170
Ask yourself, what do I want people to learn,

24
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.295
or achieve during this meeting.

25
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:07.380
Start with that goal in mind,

26
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.858
and you're more likely to end with success.

27
00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:14.370
Second, develop and communicate an agenda.

28
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.640
How will you meet your objective?

29
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.130
List all the topics that you need to cover,

30
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.680
put them in a logical order,

31
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.853
and offer any necessary background information.

32
00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:28.387
Also remember to include the meeting time and location.

33
00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.460
After reading the agenda,

34
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.950
everyone should know what to expect.

35
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.700
Third, identify the meeting participants.

36
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.100
Consider who's responsible for each item on the agenda.

37
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.160
Target the smallest number of people possible.

38
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.290
The more focused your guest list is,

39
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.406
the more focused your meeting will be.

40
00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:51.638
Finally, assign pre-work, ask yourself

41
00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:55.000
is there anything people can do now to prepare?

42
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.270
The more pre-work you assign, the more productive

43
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.379
your group conversations will be.

44
00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:03.390
Of course, your job doesn't stop at the planning stage.

45
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.670
Once you've organized the perfect meeting,

46
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.553
there's still one more thing to do,

47
00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:10.400
hold the actual meeting.

48
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.200
To keep your team on track and lead an

49
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.450
effective meeting, focus on four tips.

50
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.120
First, manage the clock by encouraging the group

51
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.050
to achieve as much as possible

52
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.290
in as little time as possible.

53
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.410
That means starting and ending on time,

54
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.250
stopping people from rehashing the same point,

55
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.760
and setting time limits if

56
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.888
a conversation goes on for too long.

57
00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:35.620
Second, stay on topic.

58
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.140
If someone mentions an issue that's

59
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.670
outside of the meeting's scope use parking lot technique,

60
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.750
which involves writing the information down and saving it

61
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.069
in a parking lot for the next meeting.

62
00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.900
Remember, if you spend too much to time on outside issues,

63
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.956
you won't have enough time to address the agenda.

64
00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:56.230
Third, encourage equal participation,

65
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.028
which can be done with the nominal group technique.

66
00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:02.860
Here's how that works, when introducing a topic,

67
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.330
first go around the room and encourage everyone

68
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.860
to share they're thoughts in 30 seconds or less.

69
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.363
Only open the conversation after you've heard that input.

70
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.350
And finally, summarize and define next steps.

71
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.150
Following each agenda item, summarize what's been shared,

72
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.823
then ask the group, what's the next step.

73
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.090
Decide what needs to happen

74
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.930
to keep the project moving forward.

75
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.180
Just remember to send out these details later

76
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.383
to improve overall understanding and accountability.

77
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.920
At the end of every meeting,

78
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.150
don't forget to ask for feedback.

79
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.100
After all, you can't fix a problem you can't see.

80
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.260
So ask your attendees what worked for them, and what didn't.

81
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.680
By following these techniques

82
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.550
and obtaining regular feedback,

83
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.350
you can hold meetings that keep your projects on track,

84
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.983
and help you move in a positive direction.
