<v ->If you're a team manager,</v>

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.400
you likely didn't get placed in your position by chance.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.330
Your commitment to develop and grow your own skills

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.730
led to your professional competency.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.610
Your commitment to develop and grow the skills of others

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.740
led you to be assigned to the role of team manager.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.080
So, one of the most important questions

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.510
to ask yourself as you move forward is,

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.250
how can I be a better manager for my team?

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.640
Here are a few tips to improve your team management skills

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.530
in three key areas,

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.283
communication, team development, and motivation.

13
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.060
First, here's a tip to improve team communication.

14
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.220
Be generous with how much information

15
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.920
you share with your team.

16
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.360
Share as much information as you can,

17
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.530
whether that's who the end user of the product will be,

18
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.720
what feedback the client gave you,

19
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.100
current challenges the company is facing,

20
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.643
or updates about issues that affect them.

21
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.710
Knowledge is only powerful when it's shared.

22
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.810
Your team will perform at a higher level

23
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.840
if everyone is operating with the same understanding.

24
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.890
Also, facilitating knowledge

25
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.220
or skill sharing between team members can build rapport

26
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.853
and create a more dynamic environment.

27
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.440
Next, let's look at team development.

28
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.280
How do you help your team members develop their skills

29
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.603
and grow as people or professionals?

30
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.410
The biggest tip is to avoid telling your team

31
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.860
all the answers.

32
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.520
Instead, provide the right amount of guidance

33
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.943
to help them find the answers themselves.

34
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.750
One of the best ways to do this

35
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.330
is to ask targeted and open-ended questions to your team,

36
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.000
such as, what do you think?

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.770
Or how would you approach this?

38
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.733
Or what steps are involved in this process?

39
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.590
And here's a bonus tip,

40
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.660
stretch your team's skills.

41
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.840
Challenge your team to slowly expand their skills,

42
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.960
try new tasks,

43
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.730
or take on increasing responsibility or autonomy.

44
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.340
Not only will you increase your team's flexibility,

45
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.570
but a little bit of healthy conflict

46
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.443
can lead to growth and higher levels of engagement.

47
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.710
These final two tips

48
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.560
address how to better motivate your team.

49
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.690
The first tip is to recognize and reward team members

50
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.050
for their efforts or good work.

51
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.220
Call out when your team

52
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.130
or individual team members overcome significant challenges,

53
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.520
go above and beyond the call of duty,

54
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.070
or deliver exceptional results.

55
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.170
Also, explore more tangible rewards

56
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.423
to incentivize your team for the long-term.

57
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.360
The second tip is to play to people's strengths.

58
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.780
Get to know the strengths

59
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.730
and interests of your team members

60
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.390
and assign tasks that fit them.

61
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.340
That will help keep your team motivated

62
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.613
and running smoothly.

63
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.680
As you're considering

64
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.010
how to enhance your team management skills,

65
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.930
try asking yourself,

66
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.760
who's a manager that I look up to?

67
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.060
Who are my role models

68
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.140
or favorite leaders from other companies?

69
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.650
You can inspire your own management practices

70
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.960
by looking at what other leaders are doing successfully

71
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.853
and learning from the best.
