00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.300
<v ->Managing teams can be tough,</v>

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.250
you're bringing in people from all different walks of life

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.870
with various experiences, skills,

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.440
and approaches to solving problems.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.270
There are bound to be occasional miscommunications

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.170
and conflicts, you will sometimes struggle

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.350
to get everyone on the same page,

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.740
or to create synergy between team members.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.300
Let's face it, team problems are inevitable,

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.650
but always remember that you have the power

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.740
and responsibility to overcome them successfully.

12
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.860
Ready to step up to the challenge?

13
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.230
Then let's explore the top four challenges teams face.

14
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.450
Along with what strategies you can take

15
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.350
to deal with them.

16
00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:48.590
The first problem is a lack of trust.

17
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.210
How can you expect team members

18
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.220
to openly share their ideas and their honest feedback

19
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.170
with each other if they don't trust one another?

20
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.430
How can you collaborate effectively with someone

21
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.170
if you don't trust their skills, their opinions,

22
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290
or their intentions?

23
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.100
One of the biggest ways that you can foster trust

24
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.710
between team members is to start demonstrating

25
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.020
trusting behaviors first.

26
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.310
Avoid micromanaging your team, delegate tasks

27
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.410
and express your confidence in each team member's abilities.

28
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.670
When your team sees that you trust them,

29
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.610
they will be encouraged to trust each other.

30
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090
The next problem is communication,

31
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.510
which includes miscommunication

32
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.129
and a lack of team communication.

33
00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:35.160
Unclear goals or responsibilities can result

34
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.070
in confusion and a lack of accountability.

35
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.210
Miscommunication can result in mistakes,

36
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.310
and a lack of communication can create a barrier

37
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.189
to strong performance.

38
00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.540
You can combat these issues by being clear and specific

39
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.950
in your communications,

40
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.240
and challenging team members to do the same.

41
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.450
Always specify the details of who, what,

42
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.080
when, where, how and why.

43
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.270
Also, check in regularly with your team to monitor progress.

44
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.957
Provide clarification and detect problems early.

45
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:12.140
Conflict is another problem that can plague

46
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.100
even the best teams.

47
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.560
Disagreements and interpersonal conflicts

48
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280
between team members can quickly create a barrier

49
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.690
to effective teamwork, productivity and collaboration.

50
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.630
They can also produce a toxic work environment

51
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.730
that is detrimental to the rest of your team.

52
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.470
You need to nip the team conflicts in the bud

53
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.900
before they grow into bigger problems.

54
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.020
Try acting as a mediator, don't play favorites

55
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.910
or take sides when resolving conflicts.

56
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.540
Listen to both sides, identify points of agreement,

57
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.390
and disagreement, and help individuals

58
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.300
develop common ground.

59
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.010
Also, don't hesitate to be assertive when communicating

60
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.810
what behaviors are accepted,

61
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.949
and what behaviors are unacceptable on the team.

62
00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.540
Last is team alignment,

63
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.880
if different team members

64
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.860
are working towards different goals,

65
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.310
then the product is going to suffer.

66
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.850
A team by definition involves people working together

67
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.720
toward shared goals.

68
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.850
So, make sure to create a vision and set boundaries.

69
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.000
Paint a picture of what success looks like for your team,

70
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.760
and clearly define any project constraints.

71
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.085
What do you want the end result to be?

72
00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:30.500
It's easy to recognize symptoms of a team in trouble,

73
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.030
you may notice reduced productivity, lower morale,

74
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.520
or declining team performance.

75
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.930
These symptoms signal that it's time to do some

76
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.720
investigative work and get to the source of the problem.

77
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.840
Treating symptoms may give your team relief

78
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.950
in the short term,

79
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.000
but you need to be able to identify the disease

80
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.510
to address the underlying cause.

81
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.420
Is it a problem with trust?

82
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.520
Communication? Conflict?

83
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.050
Or alignment?

84
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.780
It's up to you to find out

85
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.793
so that you can determine the best long term cure.
