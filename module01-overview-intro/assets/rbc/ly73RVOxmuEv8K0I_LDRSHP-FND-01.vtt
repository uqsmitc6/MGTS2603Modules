<v ->What does it mean to be a leader?</v>

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.760
Is it someone who knows all the answers?

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.990
Who performs the best?

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.940
Or is it someone who has been with the company the longest?

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.310
These are just a few

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.400
of the common myths surrounding leadership.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.020
But if you don't understand what it means to be a leader,

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.223
then how can you expect to be a great one?

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.350
So, let's clear the air

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.610
and explore what leadership actually means.

11
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.230
Then, we'll look at the five critical functions

12
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.373
of business leaders.

13
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.453
First is a definition.

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.900
Leadership is the act of influencing others

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.500
to achieve a shared outcome or a common goal.

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.950
Leadership is not necessarily tied to authority or power.

17
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.710
It involves mobilizing people

18
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.900
and inspiring them to take collective action.

19
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.290
So, what does a leader actually do?

20
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.150
Or what is a leader's primary role

21
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.530
in advancing a company's interests and growth?

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.610
Here are five of the main roles

23
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.143
that business leaders fulfill for their teams.

24
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.670
First, leaders inspire a shared vision.

25
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.730
They answer the questions, where are we going,

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.763
and how will we get there?

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.870
They share this vision with everyone in the company

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.950
to get them on board and excited about it.

29
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.230
Without a shared vision,

30
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.190
a team's efforts becomes disjointed

31
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.630
and not much gets accomplished.

32
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.700
Leaders who inspire a shared vision unite their teams

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.500
and provide them with a clear direction

34
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.970
and a sense of purpose in their work.

35
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.430
Teams take concerted action.

36
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.440
Second, leaders make things happen.

37
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.240
They make decisions, create and execute a strategy,

38
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.000
and achieve results through others.

39
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.300
Leaders create a strategy

40
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.010
or a roadmap for translating vision into reality.

41
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.760
They define what needs to happen,

42
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.853
which resources to use by whom and when.

43
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.520
That means leaders create not only the vision

44
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.293
but also a plan for how the company will get there.

45
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.300
They then execute the plan, manage changes or updates to it,

46
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.273
and take responsibility for insuring its success.

47
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.510
The third leadership function is essential.

48
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.480
It's to engage and motivate others.

49
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.170
The best leaders don't act as lone heroes or team all-stars.

50
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.860
Instead, they get things done

51
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.580
by unlocking the potential of others.

52
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.360
Leaders strategically engage the skills, strengths,

53
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.790
and expertise of the people around them.

54
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.380
They inspire, motivate,

55
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.170
and encourage employees to do their best work.

56
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.960
Another important function of leadership

57
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.980
is to develop human capital.

58
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.890
They invest in the training and professional growth

59
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.200
of the people and competencies they need

60
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.420
to sustain the company.

61
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.420
They help people cultivate the leadership skills they need

62
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.820
to manage others, solve problems,

63
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.870
and take meaningful responsibility

64
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.723
and ownership in the company.

65
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.030
Finally, leaders embody company values.

66
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.193
In other words, they lead by example.

67
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.220
They shape company culture,

68
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.350
strengthen the company's identity,

69
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.180
and exemplify the character, attitudes,

70
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.440
and behaviors that they want others to emulate.

71
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.360
Leaders inspire loyalty and respect from others

72
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.050
when they themselves act with integrity and good will.

73
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.520
Altogether, a bad leader inspires fear

74
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.380
whereas a great leader inspires excitement.

75
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.290
A bad leader blames others

76
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.840
whereas a great leader coaches others.

77
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.600
A bad leader works alone

78
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.260
whereas a great leader works through others.

79
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.940
And a bad leader depends on authority

80
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.820
whereas a great leader depends on influence.

81
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.780
Understanding what leadership means

82
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.220
and how leaders best serve their teams

83
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.710
brings you one step closer

84
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.230
to becoming a better leader yourself.

85
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.070
Avoid the pitfalls of bad leadership

86
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.960
and seek opportunities to develop

87
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.703
and hone your leadership skills.
