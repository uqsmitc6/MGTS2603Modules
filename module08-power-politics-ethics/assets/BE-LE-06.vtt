00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.950
<v ->What's the right thing to do?</v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.880
We ask this question when the choices aren't clear,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.060
or we're not sure how a decision will affect others.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.180
Making ethical decisions requires thinking

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.500
about more than just numbers and laws

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.660
or what's best for business.

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.793
So how do you make the right choice?

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.370
Ethical decision-making adds a human dimension

9
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.690
to the way we think about issues.

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.203
It means considering right and wrong.

11
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.920
Ethical decision-making asks us to think about

12
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.580
the moral implications of a choice we have to make.

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.820
For example, allowing employees to leave work early

14
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.750
before a winter storm may decrease the day's profits,

15
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.160
but it's the best decision to keep everyone safe,

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.940
but how do you make ethical decisions

17
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.780
when there are no universal rules

18
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.833
to determine right and wrong?

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.290
Well, many industries have their own set of guidelines,

20
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.070
sometimes called code of ethics.

21
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.340
One example is the Hippocratic Oath in medicine,

22
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.840
which asks physicians to avoid harm,

23
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.160
treat patients to the best of their ability,

24
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.563
and keep patient information confidential.

25
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.510
Individual companies can also have

26
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.690
their own ethical guidelines.

27
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.680
These can take the form of broader company policies,

28
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.780
organizational core values,

29
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.803
or employee codes of conduct.

30
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.660
In the absence of these preexisting codes,

31
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.023
here are four guidelines to keep in mind.

32
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.890
With any workplace decision,

33
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.330
legality must be among the first considerations.

34
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.063
Will this meet local and federal regulations?

35
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.010
Generally, your decisions should also agree

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.490
with company policy, and if it doesn't,

37
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.563
you need to be able to defend it on ethical grounds.

38
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.760
For example, if a hurricane hits a city

39
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.610
and a customer wants to return some items

40
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.010
after your 90-day return period because stores were closed,

41
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.593
do you make an exception or stick to the 90-day policy?

42
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.460
Though we shouldn't always base decisions solely

43
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.670
on what we personally think is right or wrong,

44
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.090
morality is a factor in ethical decision-making.

45
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.180
For example, an employee might be allowed to smoke

46
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.140
on the office patio,

47
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.360
but because they think it's wrong to expose others

48
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.530
to secondhand smoke, they choose to avoid smoking

49
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.363
on the patio when nonsmokers are around.

50
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.400
Fairness is key to making ethical decisions.

51
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.280
Ask yourself, will the decision affect everyone

52
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.720
in the same way,

53
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.283
or does it benefit some people over others?

54
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.950
keep these four factors in mind

55
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.373
as you go through the decision-making process.

56
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.220
So, how do we actually make a decision?

57
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.113
Let's break down the process step by step.

58
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.180
First, determine the issue.

59
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.810
What makes it an ethical decision

60
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.420
rather than a simple business matter?

61
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.840
Consider the answers to questions like,

62
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.053
does it affect employee wellbeing or consumer safety?

63
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.593
What are potential consequences for the environment?

64
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.973
Does it impact society at large?

65
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.300
Next, gather the facts.

66
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.050
Think about who's involved in the decision,

67
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.400
then ask yourself, is this a short-term or long-term issue?

68
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.360
How is it impacting the business right now?

69
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.300
Third, list all options.

70
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.040
This is when you can brainstorm creative alternatives

71
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.230
and get rid of options that don't make sense.

72
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.040
Here are some questions to help you along.

73
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.230
Is this solution legal?

74
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.220
Does this option follow company guidelines?

75
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.913
Fourth, examine and experiment with the options.

76
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.330
Think about the potential consequences of each option.

77
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.270
Are there any similar examples you can learn from?

78
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.943
Can you roll out small changes to test it out?

79
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.250
For example, a company committed to employee wellbeing

80
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.320
wants to make a fair decision when it comes to perks,

81
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.590
but they're not sure how applicable

82
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.300
the perks are to everyone,

83
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.963
so they do a trial before making them official.

84
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.210
Finally, make a decision and implement it.

85
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.700
If you're not sure if it's the right decision, ask yourself,

86
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.500
is this the best choice based on the previous steps?

87
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.883
How would the team respond to this decision?

88
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.460
Making ethical decisions isn't always easy,

89
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.070
but having a set of guidelines

90
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.260
and a step-by-step process can make

91
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.430
an ethical choice easier.

92
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.500
Remember, companies and industries

93
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.200
can have their own codes of ethics

94
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.460
to lay out important values.

95
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.900
To confront ethical decisions at work,

96
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.060
first determine the ethical aspects of a problem.

97
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.690
Once you have gathered all the facts

98
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.210
and examined your options, you can make a choice.

99
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.283
Following these steps

100
00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:51.810
will help you make sound ethical decisions

101
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.313
that will benefit your business, coworkers, and customers.
