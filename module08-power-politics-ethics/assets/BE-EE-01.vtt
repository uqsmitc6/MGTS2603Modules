00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.950
<v ->Imagine an employee asks you for a raise.</v>

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.350
They tell you that they're struggling to make ends meet,

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.540
and without the raise,

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.260
they'll need to find a job that pays better.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.410
Your company doesn't have much financial room for a raise,

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.250
but you also can't afford to hire a new person for the role.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730
Plus, the employee is very hardworking

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.200
and you sympathize with their situation.

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.770
So, what do you do?

10
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.980
Ethical dilemmas like this can leave us scratching our heads

11
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.240
because the choices aren't easy.

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.700
How do you choose when there seems to be no right answer?

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.080
Let's explore how conflicting values play a role

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.583
in those choices and how to approach resolving the dilemma.

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.200
An ethical dilemma occurs when there's a conflict

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.140
between two choices that present different values.

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.530
Why does that create a conflict?

18
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.520
Well, it's not always easy

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.980
to choose one important value over the other.

20
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.923
So, what are those conflicting values?

21
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.570
One common conflict is between truth and loyalty.

22
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.950
For example,

23
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.430
a bus driver whose coworker confesses to them

24
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.830
that they drink on their shift must choose

25
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.080
between telling the truth to their boss

26
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.893
or remaining loyal to their friend.

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.130
Another common conflict is the choice

28
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.530
between an individual and a community.

29
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.780
For example,

30
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.790
if a community is rationing medicine due

31
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.890
to a shortage of supplies,

32
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.930
should a community member

33
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.283
who is sick get more than their share?

34
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.750
Finally, many choices are about justice and mercy.

35
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.990
Let's say a longtime employee fails to lock up a store,

36
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.640
which is then robbed.

37
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.820
Is it more important to punish the employee justly

38
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.003
or show them mercy?

39
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.200
These value conflicts make choices

40
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.250
in an ethical dilemma tougher,

41
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.050
and sometimes a problem can have multiple conflicts

42
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.490
of values.

43
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.930
For example, a bus driver whose friend and coworker drinks

44
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.710
during shifts must consider truth and loyalty,

45
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130
but they must also choose between the individual

46
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.143
and the community.

47
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.780
Now let's look at five approaches

48
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.480
to solving these ethical dilemmas.

49
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.460
One way to resolve ethical dilemmas is

50
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.950
by using the common good approach.

51
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.320
This approach says that tending

52
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.713
to the good of the whole ultimately benefits everyone.

53
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.140
For example, when a company protects the environment,

54
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.090
everyone benefits from clean air and water.

55
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.610
Or when a company prioritizes a safe workplace,

56
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.720
all employees benefit.

57
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.110
To apply this approach,

58
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.060
ask yourself, "Would most people benefit from this choice?

59
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.657
And what's the best thing to do for the whole group?"

60
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.110
Another approach emphasizes individual rights.

61
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.570
This approach is about making sure

62
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.390
our choices respect other's rights.

63
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.320
For example, a rights approach raises questions

64
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.440
like, "Am I ignoring someone else's rights?",

65
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.460
as well as, "What are my rights,

66
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.750
and are they being respected?"

67
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.110
A third approach values fairness in decision-making.

68
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.000
Under this approach,

69
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.920
there's no room for favoritism or discrimination.

70
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.890
To decide on whether to use this approach,

71
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.090
consider will this action favor one group over the other?

72
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.380
Does the same standard apply to everyone,

73
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.480
regardless of their sex, race, gender,

74
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.223
or other arbitrary factors?

75
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.050
Next, there's the virtue approach,

76
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.390
which is about living up to moral ideals

77
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.033
and seeking self-improvement.

78
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.970
When we make decisions using this approach,

79
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.340
we can look for opportunities to improve ourselves morally.

80
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.280
Ask yourself, "What virtues are at stake here,

81
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.017
and will this decision help me improve as a person?"

82
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.780
Finally, consider the utilitarian approach

83
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.410
to help you look at a problem

84
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.750
from a practical point of view.

85
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.370
Under this approach, the goal of any decision is

86
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.890
to maximize happiness and minimize harm.

87
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.723
Ask yourself,

88
00:03:57.723 --> 00:04:01.110
"Does this choice benefit the maximum number of people?

89
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.547
Which decision would cause the least harm?"

90
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.000
When values conflict, ethical dilemmas occur.

91
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.770
Between truth and loyalty,

92
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.130
individual and community, or justice and mercy,

93
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.210
it's hard to know which values are more important.

94
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.740
Using different approaches can help us understand things

95
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.160
more clearly.

96
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.400
But remember, there is no single approach

97
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.420
that works for all dilemmas.

98
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.520
Practice applying each of the five approaches

99
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.430
in different situations.

100
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.240
That way you can make thoughtful choices

101
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.853
that have a positive impact.
